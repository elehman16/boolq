MOTTY
Motty (11 July 1978, Chester Zoo, Cheshire â€“ 23 July 1978, Chester Zoo, Cheshire) was the only proven hybrid between an Asian and an African elephant. He was named after George Mottershead, who founded the Chester Zoo in 1931. The male calf was born on 11 July 1978 in Chester Zoo, to Asian mother Sheba and African father Jumbolino.
APPEARANCE
Section::::Appearance.
The calf's cheek, ears (long with pointed lobes) and legs (longer and slimmer) were of the African type, while nail numbers (5 front, 4 hind) and the single trunk finger were Asian. The wrinkled trunk was like an African elephant. The forehead was sloping with one dome and two smaller domes behind it. The body was African in type, but had an Asian-type centre hump and an African-type rear hump.
CAUSE OF DEATH
Section::::Cause of death.
Despite intensive human care, Motty died of an umbilical infection 12 days after his birth on 23 July. The necropsy revealed death to be due to necrotizing enterocolitis and E. coli septicaemia. His body is preserved as a mounted specimen at the Natural History Museum, London.
OTHER HYBRIDS
Section::::Other hybrids.
There are unconfirmed rumours of three other hybrid elephants born in zoos or circuses; all are said to have been deformed and did not survive.
The straight-tusked elephant, an extinct elephant whose closest extant relative is the African forest elephant, interbred with the Asian elephant, recovered DNA has shown.
BIOLOGY
Section::::Biology.
Although the Asian elephant Elephas maximus and the African elephant Loxodonta africana belong to different genera, they share the same number of chromosomes, thus making hybridisation, at least in this respect, theoretically possible.
