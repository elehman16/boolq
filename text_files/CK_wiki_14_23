CHINESE NUMEROLOGY
In Chinese tradition, certain numbers are believed by some to be auspicious (吉利, ) or inauspicious (不利, ) based on the Chinese word that the number sounds similar to. 
The numbers 6, 8, and 9 are generally considered to be auspicious, while 4 and 7 are considered inauspicious.
ZERO
Section::::Zero.
The number 0 (零, ) is the beginning of all things and is generally considered a good number.
ONE
Section::::One.
The number 1 (一, ) is neither auspicious nor inauspicious. It is a number given to winners to indicate the first place. But it can also symbolize loneliness or being single. For example: November 11th is the Singles' Day in China, as the date has four '1' which stand for singles.
TWO
Section::::Two.
The number 2 (二 or 兩, ) is most often considered a good number in Chinese culture. There is a Chinese saying: "good things come in pairs". It is common to repeat characters in product brand names, such as the character 喜 (), can be repeated to form the character 囍 (). 
In Cantonese, 2 (二 or 兩, ) is homophone with the characters for "easy" (易, ) and "bright" (亮, ). 
* 24 () in Cantonese sounds like "easy die" (易死, ).
* 28 () in Cantonese sounds like "easy prosper" (易發, ).
THREE
Section::::Three.
The number 3 (三, ) sounds like 生 (), which means "to live" or "life" so it's considered a good number. It's significant since it is one of three important stages in a person's life (birth, marriage, and death).On the other hand, number 3 (三,) sounds like 散 () which means "to split" or "to separate" or "to part ways" or "to break up with" so it's a bad number too.
FOUR
Section::::Four.
The number 4 (四, ) is considered an unlucky number in Chinese because it is nearly homophonous to the word "death" (死 ). 
Thus, some buildings in East Asia omit floors and room numbers containing 4, similar to the Western practice of some buildings not having a 13th floor because 13 is considered unlucky. 
Where East Asian and Western cultures blend, such as in Hong Kong, it is possible in some buildings that the thirteenth floor along with all the floors with 4s to be omitted. Thus a building whose top floor is numbered 100 would in fact have just eighty one floors.
FIVE
Section::::Five.
The number 5 (五, ) sounds like "not" in Mandarin (無, ) and Cantonese (唔, ). 
* 53 () sounds like "no life" in Mandarin (無生, ) and Cantonese (唔生, ).
* 54 () sounds like "no death" in Mandarin (無死, ) and Cantonese (唔死, ).
* 58 () sounds like "no prosperity" in Mandarin (無發, ) and Cantonese (唔發, ).
Five is also associated with the five elements (Water, Fire, Earth, Wood, and Metal) in Chinese philosophy, and in turn was historically associated with the Emperor of China. For example, the Tiananmen gate, being the main thoroughfare to the Forbidden City, has five arches.
SIX
Section::::Six.
The number 6 (六, ) in Mandarin sounds like "slick" or "smooth" (溜, ). In Cantonese, 6 () sounds like "good fortune" or "happiness" (祿, 樂 ).
Therefore six is considered a good number for business.
SEVEN
Section::::Seven.
The number 7 (七, ) in Mandarin sounds like "even" in Mandarin (齊, ), so it is a good number for relationships. It also sounds like "arise" (起, ) and "life essence" (氣, ) in Mandarin.
Seven can also be considered an unlucky number since the 7th month (July) is a "ghost month". It also sounds like "to deceive" (欺, ) in Mandarin.
In Cantonese, 7 () sounds like 𨳍 (), which is a vulgar way of saying "penis".
EIGHT
Section::::Eight.
The number 8 (八, ) sounds like "發" ().
There is also a visual resemblance between 88 and 囍 (), a popular decorative design composed of two stylized characters 喜 ().
