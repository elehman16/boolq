LETHAL WEAPON (TV SERIES)
Lethal Weapon is an American buddy cop action comedy-drama television series developed by Matt Miller and based on the film franchise created by Shane Black. The show premiered on Fox on September 21, 2016 with the third season currently airing.
For its first two seasons, Lethal Weapon starred Damon Wayans as Roger Murtaugh and Clayne Crawford as Martin Riggs, mismatched detective partners who were also the main characters in the film series, originally played by Danny Glover and Mel Gibson. The series includes other characters directly or loosely inspired by characters from the films, including Leo Getz (played by Thomas Lennon)—a close friend of Riggs and Murtaugh.
In May 2018, amidst reports of bad behavior and incidents of hostility between cast and crew on the show's set, Crawford was fired from the show resulting in the Martin Riggs character being killed by his father's second son. He was subsequently replaced in the third season by Seann William Scott, as a new character named Wesley Cole. The third season premiered on September 25, 2018.
In October 2018, just weeks after the third-season premiere, Wayans announced that he will leave the series following the end-of-season production in December 2018. On October 12, 2018, it was reported that Fox had ordered an additional two episodes for the third season, bringing the total for the season to fifteen episodes. Wayans will reportedly feature in these episodes.
SYNOPSIS
Section::::Synopsis.
For the first two seasons, Roger Murtaugh, an aging detective with a wife and three children, is partnered with Martin Riggs, a younger, somewhat unstable detective whose wife and unborn child were recently murdered. While Riggs' devil-may-care methods of collaring criminals puts his and Murtaugh's lives in danger on a regular basis, the two are able to develop a respect and friendship. Following Riggs' death in season three, Wesley Cole, a former CIA operative who has been everywhere and seen everything, finds himself navigating a new partnership with Murtaugh, as he adjusts to life in Los Angeles.
