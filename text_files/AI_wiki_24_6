RADAGAST
Radagast the Brown is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. He is one of the Istari, also known as "Wizards", who were sent by the angelic Valar to aid the Elves and Men of Middle-earth in their struggle against the Dark Lord Sauron. Radagast appears in The Lord of the Rings and [[ and [[The Silmarillion]]".
LITERATURE
Section::::Literature.
Unfinished Tales explains that Radagast, like the other Wizards, came from [[Valinor]] around the year 1000 of the [[Third Age]] of Middle-earth and was one of the [[Maia (Middle-earth)Maiar]]. His original name was Aiwendil, meaning bird-friend in Tolkien's invented language of [[Quenya]]. The [[Vala (Middle-earth)Vala]] [[Yavanna]] forced the wizard [[Saruman]] to accept Radagast as a companion, which, Tolkien says, may have been one of the reasons Saruman was contemptuous of him, to the point of scornfully calling him "simple" and "a fool". However, he was an ally and confidant of [[Gandalf]], who describes him in The Hobbit as his "cousin". He was also friends with the [[shapeshiftingskin-changer]] [[Beorn]], who deemed him to be "not a bad fellow as wizards go" and also said to Gandalf that he "used to see him [Radagast] now and again".
Radagast lived for much of his time in Middle-earth at Rhosgobel in the Vales of [[Anduin]], on the western eaves of [[Mirkwood]], between [[Carrock]] and the [[Old Forest Road]], near the [[Gladden Fields]], its name deriving from [[Sindarin]] rhosc gobel meaning "brown village". Radagast had a strong affinity for – and relationship with – wild animals, and it seemed his greatest concern was with the [[olvar]] and [[kelvar]] (flora and fauna) of Middle-earth. He was wiser than any Man in all things concerning herbs and beasts. It is said he spoke the many tongues of birds, and was a "master of shapes and changes of hue". Radagast is also described by Gandalf as "never a traveller, unless driven by great need", "a worthy Wizard", and "honest".
In [[The Fellowship of the Ring]], Radagast was unwittingly used by Saruman to lure Gandalf to his tower of [[Orthanc]], where Gandalf was captured. Fortuitously, Radagast also helped rescue him by sending [[Gwaihir]] the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)Eagle]] to Orthanc with news of the movements of Sauron's forces. When Gwaihir saw that Gandalf was imprisoned on the top of the tower he carried him off to safety before Saruman realized he was gone.
The only other reference to Radagast in [[The Lord of the Rings]] is after the [[Council of Elrond]] when it is decided to summon all the allies against Sauron together. Scouts are sent to look for help, and it is reported that Radagast is not at his home at Rhosgobel and cannot be found. Tolkien makes no mention of what has happened to Radagast, and he plays no further role in events.
Tolkien wrote that Radagast gave up his mission as one of the Wizards by becoming too obsessed with animals and plants. He also wrote that he did not believe that Radagast's failure was as great as Saruman's. However, Christopher Tolkien notes in Unfinished Tales that the assumption Radagast failed in his task may not be entirely accurate considering that he was specifically chosen by Yavanna, and he may have been assigned to protect the flora and fauna of Middle-earth, a task that would not end with the defeat of Sauron and the end of the War of the Ring.
NAMES AND TITLES
Section::::Names and titles.
According to the essay The [[Istari]] from the [[Unfinished Tales]], the name Radagast means "tender of beasts" in [[Adûnaic]], another of Tolkien's fictional languages. However, Christopher Tolkien indicates that his father intended to change this derivation and bring Radagast in line with the other wizard-names, Gandalf and Saruman, by associating it with the old language of the Men of the Vales of Anduin. No alternative meaning is provided with this new association – indeed, Tolkien stated that the name was "not now clearly interpretable". His title The Brown is simply a reference to his earth-brown robes; each of the wizards had a cloak of a different colour.
In the real world, Radagast or Rodogast is extant as a variant of [[Radagaisus]], the name of a [[GothsGothic]] warlord who led an invasion of Italy in 405. [[Radegast (god)Radegast]] is also the name of a deity in [[Slavic mythology]].

Radagast is not included in [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)The Lord of the Rings film trilogy]]. Gandalf's escape from Orthanc is instead instigated by a moth that Gandalf uses to convey a message to the Eagles.
In Jackson's [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]], the character (played by [[Sylvester McCoy]]) is greatly fleshed out, compared to the original book in which he is mentioned only once. He is portrayed as an eccentric who prefers the company of animals to people, at one point using his powers to heal a dying hedgehog. Radagast is shown to be able to communicate with birds, some of which nest in his hair. In the film, Radagast is the first wizard to visit [[Dol Guldur]] after he realizes that an evil power has infected the wood he lives in. He discovers that a [[Necromancer]] ([[Sauron]]) has taken residence in the ruined fortress. In Dol Guldur he encounters the spirit of the [[Witch-king of Angmar]], as well as the shadow of the Necromancer himself, and escapes with the Morgul blade taken from the Witch-king.
Radagast's means of transportation is a sled pulled by enormous rabbits (called "Rhosgobel rabbits"), a concept entirely original to the movie. Radagast meets Gandalf, [[Bilbo BagginsBilbo]], and the Dwarves en route to [[Erebor]] (but in [[Rhudaur]]), tells them of his discovery in Dol Guldur, and gives Gandalf the dagger to present before the [[White Council]]. When [[List of The Hobbit characters#Thorin's companyThorin's Company]] are attacked by [[Orc (Middle-earth)Orcs]] riding [[Warg (Middle-earth)Warg]]s, Radagast mounts his sled and provides a distraction, leading the enemy on a chase while Gandalf and the others escape.
Later, Saruman makes contemptuous remarks about Radagast during a meeting with Gandalf, [[Elrond]], and [[Galadriel]]. He accuses the Brown Wizard of indulging in mushrooms, and dismisses Radagast's claim about the Necromancer being a true threat.
In [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]], Radagast appears with Gandalf in a few scenes. The two wizards investigate an empty tomb, determining that the [[Nazgûl]] are once again awake and have been summoned. Gandalf bids Radagast to go and tell [[Galadriel]] of all they find, and that the White Council must make a pre-emptive move on Dol Guldur. A worried Radagast watches as Gandalf enters Dol Guldur. Inside the ruins, Gandalf confronts the Necromancer and finds that he is indeed Sauron, just as Radagast had thought.
In [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]] Radagast arrives in Dol Guldur as the [[White Council]] battle Sauron and the Nazgûl, and takes the wounded Gandalf to his house. Gandalf decides to go to Erebor and tells Radagast to gather the birds and beasts; in recompense Radagast gives Gandalf his staff as Sauron shattered his prior one. Later when the eagles arrive to help defeat the Orcs at [[the Battle of the Five Armies]], Radagast is riding one of the eagles.
OTHERS
Section::::Others.
Radagast appears as a [[non-player character]] in [[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]] in the city of Ost Guruth. In the epic quest line (Volume I Book II) the player aids Radagast in dealing with corruption in the Lone-Lands, ending in a confrontation with the Gaunt-Lord Ivar, who is bested by Radagast and driven away. After the instance, Radagast relocates to the tower of Barad Dhorn in Agamaur.
In the [[Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]], Radagast is portrayed as a user of subtle magics, contrasted with the more overt kinds used by Gandalf and Saruman. Nevertheless, he has certain unique powers.
In the video game [[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Radagast is portrayed as a bumbling and eccentric character, albeit very wise and powerful. After the player character rescues Radagast from the clutches of the spider-queen Saenathra, Radagast (with the help of his animal-friends) provides Eradan, Andriel and Farin with information on the location of the dragon Urgost.
In [[Lego The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game]], Radagast is a playable character who can be found in the outskirts of [[Bree (Middle-earth)Bree]]. In the portable versions of the title, he gives the player an optional quest to find three of his birds which have been captured by enemy forces. In battle, his abilities are similar to Gandalf the Grey's, though he lacks a sword. Radagast also appears as a character in [[Lego The Hobbit (video game)Lego The Hobbit]], but with an appearance closer to his film incarnation.
