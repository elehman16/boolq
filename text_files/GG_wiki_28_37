GRAM PER CUBIC CENTIMETRE
Gram per cubic centimetre is a unit of density in the CGS system, commonly used in chemistry, defined as mass in grams divided by volume in cubic centimetres. The official SI symbols are g/cm, g·cm, or g cm. It is equivalent to the units gram per millilitre (g/mL) and kilogram per litre (kg/L). The density of water is about 1 g/cm, since the gram was originally defined as the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at its maximum density at 4 °C.
