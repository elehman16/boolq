DRIVING LICENSE IN THE PHILIPPINES
Driver's license in the Philippines consists of three types. These are Student Permit, Non-Professional driver's license, and Professional driver's license. The minimum age for driving in the Philippines is 17 years old provided that the driver has a student permit and is accompanied by a person with a valid driver's license. An applicant can only apply for a non-professional driver's license one month after acquiring a student permit and 6 months after for a professional driver's license.
