LIST OF FIFA WORLD CUP OWN GOALS
Out of over 2500 goals scored in matches at the 21 final tournaments of the FIFA World Cup, only 53 have been own goals. In 1997, FIFA published guidelines for classifying an own goal as "when a player plays the ball directly into his own net or when he redirects an opponent's shot, cross or pass into his own goal", and excludes "shots that are on target (i.e. goal-bound) and touch a defender or rebound from the goal frame and bounce off a defender or goalkeeper".
No player holds the dubious distinction of having scored multiple own goals. Mexico has had their players score own goals on four different occasions each, while France has benefited on six occasions from opponents scoring own goals. Of the 52 matches with an own goal, the team scoring the own goal won seven times and drew eight times. All but 12 own goals have been scored in the first stages of the tournament.
