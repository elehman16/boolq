BLUE RASPBERRY FLAVOR
Blue raspberry is a common flavoring for candy, snack foods, syrups, and soft drinks. The flavor ostensibly originates from Rubus leucodermis, more commonly known as the "whitebark raspberry" or "blue raspberry" for the blue-black color of its fruit.
Food products labeled as blue raspberry flavor often contain a bright blue food coloring, the most common being Brilliant Blue FCF, although this coloring is not an accurate rendition of the actual color of the fruit, which has an almost black hue when ripe. The blue color also helps distinguish raspberry-flavored foods from cherry- and strawberry-flavored foods (the former usually being colored red, and the latter also sometimes colored red but often colored pink if the same product is also available in a cherry flavor).
