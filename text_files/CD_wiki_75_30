JACKSON HOLE AIRPORT
Jackson Hole Airport is a United States public airport located seven miles (11 km) north of Jackson, in Teton County, Wyoming. In 2015, it was the busiest airport in Wyoming by passenger traffic with 313,151 passengers. During peak seasons, Jackson Hole has nonstop airline service from 13 destinations throughout the United States including New York–JFK, Chicago–O'Hare, and Los Angeles International Airport. During shoulder seasons, airline service is limited to the hubs of Salt Lake City, Denver and Dallas/Fort Worth. The airport is served year-round by American Eagle, Delta Connection and United Express, and seasonally by mainline American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines and United Airlines.
Jackson Hole Airport is the only commercial airport in the United States located inside a national park, in this case Grand Teton. (The Provincetown Municipal Airport in Massachusetts is on land leased from the National Park Service, but it is not in a national park.)
HISTORY
Section::::History.
The airport was created in the 1930s as the best place to put an airport in Teton County. The airport was declared a national monument in 1943, and merged with Grand Teton National Park in 1950. The runway was extended to its current length in 1959. In the 1960s and 1970s a runway extension to to allow jets was considered; the National Park Service successfully opposed it. In the late 1970s jets began using the existing runway. The area is noise sensitive and the airport allows no jets louder than stage III. The airport is a popular mating ground for the rare sage grouse.
Airlines that previously served Jackson Hole include Horizon Air, Frontier Airlines, Western Airlines, Continental Airlines, Big Sky Airlines, and Northwest Airlines. Southwest Airlines served the airport in the 1985-1986 winter season.
FACILITIES
Section::::Facilities.
Jackson Hole Airport covers ; its one runway, 1/19, is 6,300 x 150 ft (1,920 x 46 m) asphalt. 
Jackson Hole Airport is noise sensitive and bans older, noisier aircraft with stage-II engines.
The airport once had an unusual terminal resembling a pioneer log cabin. The terminal was completely rebuilt between 2009 and 2014. The new terminal, designed by Gensler, still blends with the unique surroundings of the national park with exposed wood, fireplaces, and nature photography throughout. The park limited the height of the terminal building to 18 feet. The terminal design received an American Institute of Architects Honor Award in 2014. The airport currently has nine hard stand gates and three baggage carousels. Jackson Hole Airport does not have jet bridges so passengers board aircraft via airstairs. The airport terminal has three cafes and two gift shops.
Jackson Hole Airport is one of 16 airports that uses private screeners under contract with the Transportation Security Administration's Screening Partnership Program. Security screeners are employed by the Jackson Hole Airport Board rather than the TSA.
The largest aircraft seen regularly is the Boeing 757-200 operated by United Airlines and Delta Air Lines. Other aircraft typically seen include the Airbus A319 and A320, Boeing 737-700, Embraer 175, and the Bombardier CRJ-700 regional jet. Due to its high altitude and short runway, Jackson Hole Airport does not typically see stretched versions of aircraft such as the Airbus A321 or Boeing 737-900ER.
