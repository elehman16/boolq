Section::::Season 1 (2017).
In the early 2000s, Vito Rizzuto (Anthony LaPaglia) is the boss of a crime family, seeking to bring peace to Montreal's criminal world. He succeeds, but, after being implicated and arrested for multiple murders committed in 1981, his empire crumbles. While in prison, Vito's son, Nico Jr. (Brett Donahue) and his father, Nicolo Rizzuto (Paul Sorvino) are murdered by his adversaries, while the family was entrusted to his right-hand man, Declan Gardiner (Kim Coates). Shipments of drugs are also picked off by the main antagonist, Sal Montagna (Joris Jarsky). Meanwhile, Quebec Superior Court Justice France Charbonneau (Claudia Ferri) is in charge to fight the corruption within the Rizzuto family. Upon Vito's release in 2012, he shuns his right-hand man, Declan Gardiner (Kim Coates), for the deaths in his family under his watch, later forgiving him as he sets out on a path of revenge against anyone who ever crossed the Rizzuto family. Declan, feeling betrayed, secretly switches allegiance to that of Sal, before killing him. Declan also later poisons Vito, killing him, as Declan is left as Montreal's drug kingpin.
SEASON 2 (2018)
Section::::Season 2 (2018).
Five years after Vito Rizzuto's death, his former right-hand man, Declan, is the reigning king of the Montreal drug trade. Declan comes up against rivals, when he refuses to partner with new arrivals, the son and daughter twins, Teresa (Anna Hopkins) and Christian Langana (Gianni Falcone), of a head mobster from Calabria, Italy. They wage war in an attempt to wrestle the city from his grasp. The Langanas, related to Hamilton's Cosoleto brothers, Domenic (Louis Ferreira) and Enzo (Daniel Kash), and their sons, Luca (Franco Lo Presti) and Nats (Dylan Taylor), disrupt the balance of the family, and start dealing in the more dangerous fentanyl. Meanwhile, the organized crime division, headed by Nellie Bullock (Lisa Berry), gets ready to take everyone down with the help of a confidential informant, Nats' wife, Valentina Cosoleto (Melanie Scrofano). Although he prefers to work alone, Declan soon realizes that, in order to remain on top, he enlists some help from Rose Sunwind (Sharon Taylor) to help move his product, the leader of the Sunwind family off their Indian reserve near Montreal. Declan also takes his nephew Reggie Ross (Ryan McDonald) under his wing after his release from prison. After Nats is sent to prison after he unintentionally kills a bystander, Valentina, not knowing she is being recorded by the police, reveals to Nats that she was informant. After Domenic is made aware of the tape, he is left with no choice but to murder Valentina. As part of Declan's elaborate plan to take down the Langanas, he later gains the protection contract of Nats in prison, orders his beating, and forces Enzo to turn informant if he wants his son to live. Domenic, who is made aware of Enzo's situation, tells the Langanas, where Christian kills him. As the Langanas are about to leave town, Declan's plan is unfolding; he finds out where they live and follows them. When they realize they are being followed, a shootout ensues where Declan kills Christian; Teresa escapes, and cleans-house by arranging the murders of Nats and Enzo. She finds out from the bikers that Declan is living with Rose on her reserve, where they take him, Rose and Reggie captive. Teresa kills Reggie and shoots Declan. Declan, not mortally wounded, kills Teresa as she walks to a helicopter to make her escape. With all of Nellie's leads dead, the RCMP shuts down the organized crime division. With the Langanas dead, Declan wins the war for his city.
RECEPTION
Section::::Reception.
The first season reached a total of 3.2 million Canadian viewers.
The Toronto Star has called the series a Canadian "Sopranos". John Doyle of The Globe and Mail praised the first season, calling it "very superior docu-drama: gripping, richly textured and unfussily focused not just on the violent dynamics of a successful mob operation but on what happens when a strong leader is absent and the centre of power disintegrates." Doyle also praised the second season, calling it "not only nifty entertainment, it's a deftly made, superior crime drama, forensically smart about family and business power."
