The Select was a continuation of the first generation Rogue sold alongside an all-new Rogue that went on sale in 2013 as a 2014 model. Since the production capacity allowed for the first generation to be built in conjunction with the 2nd generation, it allowed for a lower entry price to Rogue customers as well as fleet sales. It went on sale in January 2014 as a 2014 model year vehicle and was continued through 2015. Nissan then announced that 2015 would be the final year. The Rogue Select was not offered in Canada.
The Rogue Select was built in Nissan's Kyushu, Japan plant.

Manufacture of the 2014 Rogue began at Smyrna, Tennessee as the facility's 10 millionth vehicle.
Production of the Rogue crossover at South Korean manufacturer Renault Samsung Motors's Busan plant started in September 2014, with an annual capacity of about 80,000 units.

2014–Present Model years (Not including Rogue Select)
Small Overlap Front Driver: Good
Small Overlap Front Passenger: Good
Moderate Overlap Front Driver: Good
Side Impact: Good
Roof Strength: Good
The Small Overlap Test, introduced in 2012 by the IIHS simulates a frontal collision on 25% of the driver's side. Since its adoption, the IIHS has noticed several automakers making non-symmetrical modifications to their vehicles, the Rogue being one of them. Another Small Overlap Test was conducted on a number of vehicles including a 2014 Rogue, but was conducted on the passenger side instead. Based on this test, the Rogue would have received a "Marginal" rating if the IIHS were to provide ratings for passenger-side protection. The crash test's intrusion was 10 inches further into the vehicle on the passenger's side than on the driver's side and completely tore off the structural door hinge pillar on the passenger side.
The Rogue was redesigned for the 2014 model year. The redesigned Rogue shares no ratings with the previous design, built since the 2008 model year and given a new name for 2014-15, the Rogue Select. Starting with the 2014 year, the Rogue was awarded Top Safety Pick+ by IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety).
Nissan vehicles built 2014 to 2017 were put under a recall as the occupant classification sensor (OCS) would think that an adult in the passenger seat is a child. They recalled over 6 million vehicles for either reprogramming or replacing.
