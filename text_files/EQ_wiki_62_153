DESTINATION TRUTH
Destination Truth is a weekly American paranormal reality television series that premiered on June 6, 2007, on Syfy. Produced by Mandt Bros. Productions and Ping Pong Productions, the program follows paranormal researcher Josh Gates around the world to investigate claims of the supernatural, mainly in the field of cryptozoology. The third season concluded on April 21, 2010, and currently holds the highest ratings ever for the series, which continued with a fourth season, beginning on Thursday, September 9, 2010, at 9:00 p.m. ET/PT. The fifth season began July 10, 2012. On March 27, 2014, Gates confirmed via his Facebook account that Destination Truth had ended its run and would not be returning for a sixth season. However, Travel Channel began airing reruns of the show in the spring of 2017.
FORMAT
Section::::Format.
Each episode runs for about 45 minutes and typically features two investigations of paranormal activity, usually involving the search for cryptozoological creatures. Gates and his team venture out to various locations around the world where Gates interviews witnesses, reviews any physical evidence they might have, and researches the local history. Later, Gates and his team go into the field, often after nightfall, in an attempt to capture firsthand evidence of the existence of these legendary creatures. Any evidence gathered is then sent to independent experts, generally laboratories or academics in the United States, for further analysis.
The cases rely heavily on field investigation. Typically, Gates' team members split up into two or more groups to survey an area using night vision and thermal imaging cameras. They also commonly use electromagnetic field monitoring and detection equipment when cases contain claims of the supernatural. The team use walkie-talkies to relay findings to a base camp, but also carry backpack mounted cameras, microphone rigs, and hand held night vision systems to gather evidence, and to replace a traditional camera and sound crew.
Footage from the show is usually edited from an entertainment perspective that relies on "suspense building mechanisms" such as brief segments involving team members becoming agitated or startled, asserting they have seen or heard something of interest and then followed by a sudden cut to a commercial break. Conclusion of what happened is then revealed after the break.
At the end of each segment the show details the teams findings with a brief dialog in which Gates typically either states that the accounts on which the case was based are largely myth, or that they are supported by the team's findings.
