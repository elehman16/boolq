PLOT
Section::::Plot.
The story features 17-year-old Dhampir (half-human, half-vampire) guardian-in-training Rose Hathaway (Zoey Deutch), and her princess Moroi (the peaceful, mortal vampires) best friend Lissa Dragomir (Lucy Fry) living discreetly within our world, having escaped from their boarding school St. Vladimir's Academy one year prior to the beginning of the story, following a series of warnings and threats. They are soon dragged back to the Academy in Montana and rediscover the dangerous hierarchy within it, along with lies, rumors and secrets, both struggling to fit into the school politics. Rose starts to form an attraction to her Russian Dhampir mentor and fellow Guardian, Dimitri Belikov (Danila Kozlovsky).
Mysterious messages threatening Lissa start to appear (messages written on the wall in blood and an exploding memorial to her family in the school church), but it turns out to be the work of classmate Mia Rinaldi (Sami Gayle), who once dated Lissa's brother Andre, a playboy who enjoyed non-committal relationships. Mia was clingy and focused her hatred towards Lissa as the only surviving member of the Dragomir line. Manipulating two other students using sex, she persuaded them to help her in her fear tactics against Lissa. A Moroi named Christian Ozera (Dominic Sherwood), who is viewed poorly by his peers because his parents became Strigoi (the evil, undead vampires of legend, which Moroi become if they completely drain their victims of blood), tries to romance Lissa but Rose manages to keep him away by lying to both Lissa and Christian. 
Rose also discovers that Lissa has the same rare power that the founder of their school St. Vladimir had, that of Spirit, a power which enables the caster to heal ailments, and save the dying; however, using Spirit drains the user's life energy bit by bit with each use. At the same time, dead animals have been popping up wherever Lissa goes, including her beloved cat Oscar. At the Equinox Dance, Rose confronts Mia, believing she is responsible for all the dead animals. Mia, however, is horrified because she loves cats and gave Oscar treats. Soon, Lissa is kidnapped and Rose, Dimitri, and Christian go to save her.
The Moroi responsible for Lissa's kidnapping and the threats against her is Victor Dashkov, a previous candidate for the throne, who has contracted a disease that leaves him too feeble for the job. He wants to use Lissa to cure himself, even knowing that the cure would cost Lissa's life as continued healing would eventually take its toll on her. Once captured and placed in the secure cells beneath the school, Victor explains to Rose that the reason why she bonded to Lissa (and is therefore sometimes able to see through her eyes) is because she was "shadow-kissed", having been brought back to life by Lissa's magic. While they are talking, Victor's daughter Natalie (Sarah Hyland), who befriended both Lissa and Rose and was a very insecure, almost invisible, student at the school, is enacting the tools of her escape having turned Strigoi by draining her crush to death. Rose helps Dimitri kill Natalie and detain Victor.
During a speech by vampire Queen Tatiana Ivashkov (Joely Richardson), Lissa steps in and gives a speech of her own, announcing that Spirit is her type of magic, and that it is thanks to Rose (who will help keep her from straying from the person she truly is) that she can master it. Rose then goes outside to meet Dimitri and ask about his feelings for her. He states that he can't love her because if there was any danger between Rose and Lissa, he would save her instead of Lissa. Rose gives Dimitri a kiss on the cheek and walks back to the academy. The scene then shifts to a mountain cave not too far from the academy, where a massive army of Strigoi reside, among them being Miss Karp (Claire Foy), a teacher with Spirit Magic that turned herself Strigoi after being driven insane by her magic. She says it will be time soon.

RECEPTION
BOX OFFICE
Section::::Reception.
Section::::Box office.
The film underperformed and made $3,921,742 in its opening weekend, ranking number 7 in the US box office. The film later opened in a further 12 countries, but did not pass the $1 million mark, grossing just $619,381.
As of February 16, 2014, the film had grossed $6,663,650, with many suggesting that poor box office returns will effectively end any plans for a sequel. After a month of theatrical release in the US, Vampire Academy grossed just $7,742,311 at the box office. The film was expected to be a big hit in both Australia and Russia, but only made $1.6 million in each country. As of April 10, 2014, the film had earned $7,791,979 domestically and $7,600,000 overseas for a worldwide total of $15,391,979, therefore failing to recoup its $30 million budget making the film a box office bomb.
Poor international box office takings led to the cancelation of the film's theatrical release in Brazil and the United Kingdom.
CRITICAL RECEPTION
Section::::Critical reception.
Vampire Academy was not screened for critics, and has received overwhelmingly negative reviews. The film currently holds a 12% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 3.2 out of 10. The consensus states: "Though it may appeal to its built-in fanbase, Vampire Academys Twilight-meets-Mean Girls conceit borrows lazily from its predecessors and offers few laughs or thrills to complement its overstuffed backstory." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 30 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews" from critics.
The film was mostly criticized for its script, action sequences, and CGI effects, though the film's attempts to satirize the YA novel adaptation trend's cliches were warmly received. Peter Travers from Rolling Stone gave the film zero stars out of four and wrote, "One idea, mixed with lame jokes, and stretched beyond coherence. Vampire Academy doesn't need a review. It needs a stake in the heart." Dennis Harvey from Variety also gave the movie a negative review, stating it "Not only plays like the crassest possible mashup of Harry Potter and Twilight elements, but seems designed to make those franchises look like eternal monuments of world culture by comparison." Manohla Dargis from The New York Times said "[Mr. Waters] doesn't seem especially interested in the supernatural parts of Vampire Academy, and he clearly didn't have the budget to make what little hocus pocus there is, magical." The cast was also panned, with critics singling out Deutch's performance as a "ripoff" of Ellen Page as Juno from the film of the same name. Kevin A. Rason of MovieCrypt.com noted Fry for displaying occasional charisma but compared her at other moments to "nails on a chalkboard".

CANCELLED SEQUEL
Section::::Cancelled sequel.
At the Los Angeles premiere, screenwriter Daniel Waters confirmed that he had finished the first draft of the script for the sequel Frostbite. After the critical and financial failure of Vampire Academy, sequel plans were put on hold. In an interview with a radio station, Mark Waters said that the producers were trying to make the second film of the franchise by using reused money and lowering the production budget. It was revealed on August 6 that they had investors, but that they would only finance the film if enough fan support was shown. A fundraising campaign on indiegogo.com was started with the goal of reaching $1.5 million within a month. The campaign offered perks for people who donated more than $10. Piers Ashworth wrote the script with filming planned to begin in early 2015 based on cast availability, and a possible release date for Fall 2015. Fans raised $50,000 in the first five hours and $100,000 on the first day. eBay auctions for character clothing such as the Academy uniforms and the Equinox dresses were placed in late August. A month after the start of the campaign, fans had donated $254,500, just 17% of the $1.5 million goal. Fans raised an overall of $272,882 from the auctions and the donations, therefore not reaching the goal. Preger Entertainment canceled the film the next day.
