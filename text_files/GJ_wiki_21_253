DEXTER (SEASON 1)
The first season of Dexter is an adaptation of Jeff Lindsay's first novel in the Dexter series, Darkly Dreaming Dexter. Subsequent seasons have featured original storylines. This season aired from October 1, 2006 to December 17, 2006, and follows Dexter's investigation of "The Ice Truck Killer". Introduced in the first episode, "Dexter", this serial killer targets prostitutes and leaves their bodies severed and bloodless. At the same time, Dexter's foster sister, Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter), a vice squad officer, aspires to work in the homicide department, and Dexter's girlfriend, Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), wants their relationship to be more intimate. Christian Camargo appears as Rudy Cooper and is a recurring character until the end of the season.
The show's first season received generally favorable reviews from critics; it was praised as "bold, different and exciting, with a central character and performance that take your breath away" by the New York Daily News. The Wall Street Journal saw "the grotesqueries of Dexter" as "not something that can easily be dismissed with the old "'you don't have to watch' line", and concluded that "We do have to live among the viewers who will be desensitized, or aroused, by this show". The aggregate site Metacritic scored the show's first season at 77 out of 100 based on 27 critics reviews.
The season received high ratings for Showtime; the pilot episode attracted more than a million viewers, giving the channel its highest ratings in nearly two years, while the finale "Born Free" drew an audience of 1.1 million viewers in the U.S. On average, the season was watched by two million viewers per episode during its original run when factoring in DVR viewers. Due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild strike and encouraged by the show's critical success and high ratings on Showtime, CBS, a national terrestrial broadcast network, announced in December 2007 that it was considering airing an edited version of the first season of Dexter for free-to-air broadcast. It began to broadcast it on February 17, 2008, and thus, Dexter became the first program in 20 years to air on a broadcast network after being shown on a premium cable channel. During the show's rerun on the CBS network in 2008, the ratings were much higher, reaching 8.2 million viewers during its premiere February, giving the network its best rating in the 10 p.m. timeslot since December the previous year. During its 12-week run, it dropped to 7.1 million in early April, and to 6.6 million during the season's finale on May 6.
PLOT
Section::::Plot.
Dexter Morgan, a blood splatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department, is secretly a serial killer, arising from a traumatic incident connected to the death of his mother when he was three years old. His adoptive father, Officer Harry Morgan, saw these homicidal tendencies in Dexter as he grew up, and took him on hunting trips to sate his desires to kill. When Dexter admits to having desires to kill people, his adoptive father influences him to develop a "code": only kill murderers and other violent criminals who have escaped prosecution of the law. Since Harry's death, Dexter has killed multiple people, all the while adhering to the code. As his father has taught him, he covers his tracks by taking the victim to a prepared room lined with plastic sheeting in order to easily dispose of the evidence at sea. He only keeps a blood sample of the victim on a glass slide, stored in a box hidden in his apartment. Neither his foster sister Debra Morgan nor those in the department known of his secret killings, though Sgt. James Doakes is suspicious of how interested Dexter is in reviewing crime scenes. To help appear normal, Dexter has started dating Rita, the mother of Astor and Cody, and whose husband Paul is in jail due to drug-related crimes. Because Paul is still alive, Dexter finds Rita has little interest in romance, keeping their relationship ideal for his purposes. Paul is eventually let out of prison, and tries to get together with Rita, despite the fact that Rita was planning a divorce with him. Seeing Paul get abusive with Rita, Dexter frames Paul for possession of illegal drugs, sending him back to prison.
A string of murders of prostitutes leads to the identification of a new serial killer called "The Ice Truck Killer", due to how the victims' bodies are well-preserved by being kept chilled before they are found. Dexter identifies patterns of the serial killer from his own habits, and lets Debra know, helping the department get a lead on the killer and leading to Debra's promotion to Homicide. Her investigation leads her to meet Rudy Cooper, a prosthetics expert, and they start a relationship. Meanwhile, Dexter discovers that the Ice Truck Killer has broken into his apartment and left taunting clues, leading Dexter to believe that the Killer is playing a game with him.
During the investigation of the Killer, Dexter discovers that his biological father, Joe Driscoll, had only died recently, leading him to question his memories of how his mother died. A gruesome, blood-filled murder scene causes Dexter to recall exactly what had happened: criminals had placed him and his mother, Laura Moser, in a shipping container, killed Laura and dismembered her with chainsaws, and locked Dexter up in the container in a pool of his mother's blood, rescued by Harry two days later. Harry had purposely altered the records to prevent Dexter from finding out.
Through Debra, Rudy tries to get closer to Dexter. Dexter comes first to realize that Rudy killed Joe, and later affirms that he is the Ice Truck Killer. With his identity blown, Rudy kidnaps Debra and draws Dexter into a trap to rescue her. Rudy reveals to Dexter that he is his older brother Brian Moser, also left in the shipping container when Laura was killed. However, unlike Dexter, he was sent off to live in series of mental institutions. Brian too has developed serial killer tendencies, but did not have the morals that Harry instilled in Dexter, and used the Ice Truck Killer approach to help Dexter recall his past. Brian suggests to Dexter they kill Debra together, but Dexter refuses. Brian gets away after a fight, and Dexter rescues Debra.
As police investigate, Doakes suspects Dexter of being the Ice Truck Killer, but Debra vouches for him. Brian attempts to capture Debra again, but falls into a trap laid by Dexter. Dexter apologizes to Brian before killing him, though leaving Brian's body to make it appear as suicide. The police rule the Ice Truck Killer case closed, though Doakes keeps close tabs on Dexter, still suspicious of his actions. Rita discovers evidence that Dexter may have set up Paul.
