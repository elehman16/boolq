HIMALAYAN SALT
Himalayan salt is rock salt (halite) from the Punjab region of Pakistan. Numerous health claims have been made concerning Himalayan salt, but there is no scientific evidence that it is healthier than common table salt; such claims are considered pseudoscience.
HISTORY
Section::::History.
Although its salt is sometimes marketed as "Jurassic Sea Salt", this salt deposit comes from a seabed of the Permian and Cretaceous eras 100 to 200 million years ago. The first records of mining are from the Janjua people in the 1200s. Himalayan salt is mostly mined at the Khewra Salt Mine in Khewra, Jhelum District, Punjab, which is situated in the foothills of the Salt Range hill system in the Punjab province of the Pakistan Indo-Gangetic Plain.
MINERAL COMPOSITION
Section::::Mineral composition.
Himalayan salt is chemically similar to table salt. Some salts mined in the Himalayas are not suitable for use as food or industrial use without purification due to impurities. Some salt crystals from this region have an off-white to transparent color, while impurities in some veins of salt give it a pink, reddish, or beet-red color.
USES
Section::::Uses.
Himalayan salt is used to flavor food. There is no evidence that it is healthier than common table salt. In the United States, where the salts are manufactured as dietary supplement capsules bearing false claims of health benefits, the Food and Drug Administration warned one manufacturer about inadequate manufacturing practices and illegal advertising. 
Blocks of salt are also used as serving dishes, baking stones, and griddles. Himalayan salt is also manufactured into glowing salt lamps, which are hollowed then lit with electric lighting. Numerous health claims have been made concerning salt lamps, but no scientific evidence supports these claims.
