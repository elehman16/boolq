1982 FIFA WORLD CUP
Section::::1982 FIFA World Cup.
The 1982 FIFA World Cup campaign is considered to be one of the most memorable sporting achievements in New Zealand's history, and helped to galvanise the country after the controversial 1981 Springbok Tour had divided the nation and left the popularity of Rugby Union at an all-time low.
The New Zealand squad, made up mostly of amateurs, set several World Cup records on their road to Spain by playing the most matches to qualify (15 in total), travelling further than any other team in a single qualifying campaign (88,000 km), recording the largest margin of victory in a qualifying match (13-0 against Fiji (since surpassed by Australia's 22-0 rout of Tonga in 2002, and then their 31-0 demolition of American Samoa two days later)) and the longest period without conceding a goal set by goalkeeper Richard Wilson (921 minutes; a record which still stands today).
The 1982 campaign was also the first time that New Zealand wore an all white strip which gave rise to their nickname "All Whites". New Zealand's previous strip featured a white shirt with black shorts, based on the English strip, and it wasn't until their third match against Taiwan that the all white strip was introduced.
Round 1
The 1982 World Cup was the first edition to have 24 spots available (up from 16) and two spots were allocated to the Asian and Oceanian regions. A total of 21 AFC and OFC teams entered the competition, however, Iran withdrew before playing any matches.
The remaining 20 teams were divided into four groups, each with their own formats. New Zealand were drawn into Group 1 along with Australia, Chinese Taipei, Fiji, and Indonesia, where each team would play the other on a home-and-away basis. The winners of each of the four groups – New Zealand, China PR, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia – progressed to Round 2.

Round 2
Round 2 consisted of the top team from each group in Round 1. Each team played each other on a home and away basis in Round 2, with the top two teams qualifying for the World Cup in Spain.
After five matches, New Zealand found themselves in third place, three points and five goals behind China PR. For New Zealand to qualify, they had to beat Saudi Arabia by six goals to finish ahead of China PR on goal difference. Despite scoring five in the first half, New Zealand were unable to add to their tally and the match finished 5-0, thus putting New Zealand level on points and goal difference with China PR, and forcing a play-off.
