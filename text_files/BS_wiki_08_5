FRENCH TOAST CRUNCH
French Toast Crunch is a breakfast cereal launched in 1995 naturally flavored to taste like French toast, by the General Mills company. The cereal pieces originally looked like mini slices of French toast, but General Mills changed the cereal to a style similar in appearance to Cinnamon Toast Crunch; a thin, wavy square sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar flavoring.
In 2006, General Mills discontinued French Toast Crunch in the United States. Popular demand led General Mills to reintroduce the product on December 5, 2014.
During this time, French Toast Crunch was and still is produced and marketed in Canada as "French Toast Crunch" and "Croque pain dor√©." Canadian French Toast Crunch is made in the original recipe and form (mini French toast). It is available at most big retail chains including Walmart, Kroger, Target, and Costco.
