RESURRECTION OF EVIL
THE LOST MISSION
Section::::Plot.
Section::::The Lost Mission.
The player takes the role of the last surviving member of Bravo team, which was seen being ambushed by demons in Doom 3. The Bravo team survivor is contacted by Dr. Richard Meyers (voiced by Paul Eiding), a scientist working on teleportation experiments in Exis Labs, and asked to help Meyers destroy an experimental teleportation array that was captured by the demons and is currently held deep inside Hell. The array is potentially powerful enough to send an army of demons all the way to Earth, hence Meyers' desperation to destroy it. To achieve this goal, the marine must acquire the components necessary to activate the Exis Labs teleportation system, then travel to Hell in order to destroy the teleportation array. In the epilogue, the marine is teleported by Dr. Meyers back to Mars. The reinforcements from Earth arrive to search for another marine who is still missing; eventually, they find him in the Delta Labs complex.
RECEPTION
Section::::Reception.
The game received mixed reviews. The updated graphics, sound design, and inclusion of the new Lost Mission content were praised. Criticism was directed at the BFG Editions's long load times, forced auto-saves, and control scheme which forces the player to cycle through their weapons continuously in order to access a particular weapon â€“ a feature deemed extremely inappropriate given the game's suspenseful, action-oriented gameplay. The controls overall were considered a step backwards due to the previous generation ports of Doom 3 allowing players to assign weapons to hotkeys. The inability to toggle back to the traditional flashlight mechanic of the original game was also criticized.
