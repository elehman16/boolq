Although the storyline is set at the Royal Mint of Spain, the series was filmed at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) headquarters, which bears a passing resemblance to the mint in Madrid.
MUSIC
Section::::Music.
The Italian anti-fascist song "Bella ciao" is sung multiple times throughout the series. The character Tokyo recounts in one of her narrations, "The life of the Professor revolved around a single idea: Resistance. His grandfather, who had fought against the fascists in Italy, taught him the song and he taught us." The song is also played in other emblematic moments, such as when the thieves succeed in their escape out of the Mint—a metaphor for freedom.
Because of the popularity of the series, a version of "Bella ciao" interpreted by El Profesor and Berlin (two of the main characters in the series) charted in France, debuting at number five in May 2018 on the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP), the official French singles chart. A remixed version of the same song by Hugel had peaked on the SNEP at number 16 in April 2018, as well as reaching number two on the German GfK Entertainment Charts. Other versions chartin in France include one by The Bear, whiched reached number 45, a version by Sound of Legend that reached number 34, and one by Manu Pilas that reached number 27. The rapper Rémy sampled on the song adding French rapping verses. This version reached number 66 on the French chart. A revamped version with new lyrics in French, only keeping a few lines in Italian, was released by Maître Gims, Vitaa, Dadju, Slimane and Naestro in May 2018.
