LIST OF TALLEST BUILDINGS IN THE UNITED STATES
The world's first skyscraper was built in Chicago in 1885. Since then, the United States has been home to some of the world's tallest skyscrapers. New York City, specifically the borough of Manhattan, notably has the tallest skyline in the country. Eleven American buildings have held the title of tallest building in the world (9 in New York City). New York City and Chicago have always been the centers of American skyscraper building. The 10-story Home Insurance Building, built in Chicago in 1885, is regarded as the world's first skyscraper; the building was constructed using a novel steel-loadbearing frame which became a standard of the industry worldwide.
As of 2018, One World Trade Center in New York City is considered to be the tallest skyscraper in the United States. Its spire brings the structure to a symbolic height of , connoting the year The Declaration of Independence was signed, though the tip of the structure actually is measured at . However, using the more common criterion for the height of a building (the roof, not antenna) the observation deck elevation and highest occupied floor of One World Trade Center are surpassed by Chicago's Willis Tower (formerly and still commonly known as the Sears Tower) and 432 Park Avenue.
Prior to the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City, the twin towers of the World Trade Center occupied the second and third positions on the list below, behind Willis Tower. The North Tower stood at , while the South Tower was tall. If they were still standing today, they would occupy the fourth and fifth positions on the list below, with their replacement—One World Trade Center—being excluded.
There are numerous supertall buildings both proposed and under construction throughout the country, concentrated in New York City and Chicago. Projects in New York include the Central Park Tower and 111 West 57th Street, while in Chicago, proposed structures include the Vista Tower, which will be approximately 95 stories and about tall; Wolf Point along the Chicago River; the Thompson Center Redevelopment, a 115 story tower that will be 1,706 feet (520 m) tall, the proposed 2,000 foot (610 m) Gateway Tower located in the Streeterville neighborhood near Navy Pier, and a Rafael Vinoly-designed tower. Other tall buildings that are proposed include the One Bayfront Plaza and One Brickell City Centre in Miami.
