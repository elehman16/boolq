OVERVIEW
Section::::Overview.
Set between and , The Freemaker Adventures centers on a family of three young siblings — young boy Rowan, his sister Kordi, and their brother Zander — known as the Freemakers, who salvage parts from destroyed or damaged ships in order to build new ones, which they sell to make a living in their shop aboard a space station known as the Wheel. They are accompanied by their salvaged battle droid R0-GR. 
The family soon become enmeshed in the battle between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance when Rowan discovers part of an ancient artifact known as the Kyber Saber.

In the second season, the Freemakers join the Rebel Alliance.
CAST AND CHARACTERS
MAIN
* Nicolas Cantu as Rowan Freemaker, the young 12-year-old Force-sensitive member of the family who often has trouble with paying attention to his older siblings and other authority figures. Once trained in the use of the Force, he begins to use it constructively, thus becoming a successor of an ancient group of Jedi known as Force-Builders. His special sensitivity to kyber crystals make him a target for several nefarious adversaries throughout the series, including Emperor Palpatine and Graballa the Hutt.
* Vanessa Lengies as Kordi Freemaker, the tomboyish, money-conscious female middle sibling of the family who is fiercely protective of her younger brother Rowan and disapproves of his involvement in the quest for the Kyber Saber.
* Eugene Byrd as Zander Freemaker, the eldest son of the family and a mechanic who specializes in creating new ships and devices from leftover components. He hates his creations being called "Uglies", preferring the term "Z-Wings", and has a weakness for pretty ladies, including Naare (despite the fact that she's a Sith), Rebel pilot Lt. Valeria, and Becky Smoochenbacher (voiced by Dove Cameron), a resident of the Wheel.
* Matthew Wood as R0-GR (pronounced Roger), the family's reprogrammed battle droid servant and friend.

THE EMPIRE

After each failure to capture the Freemakers, he is relocated to another Empire-controlled planet which happens to be visited by the Freemakers in short order, causing him yet another humiliating defeat.
* Jeff Bennett as Plumestriker, Durpin's second-in-command who lacks his superior's healthy fear of the perils of being in a command position in the Empire and is eager for Durpin to climb the Imperial ladder.
