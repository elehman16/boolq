NISSAN PATHFINDER
The Nissan Pathfinder is a mid-size SUV manufactured by Nissan since 1986, originally sharing Nissan's compact pickup truck platform, and now in its fourth generation.
The Pathfinder is marketed as the Terrano outside North America. Beginning in 2004, the R51 series was marketed internationally as the Pathfinder and were the first marketed in the UK.
FIRST GENERATION WD21 SERIES (1987–1995)
Section::::First generation WD21 series (1987–1995).
The first generation Pathfinder was introduced as a two-door body-on-frame SUV, sharing styling and most components with the Nissan Hardbody Truck. Built on a ladder-type frame, the Pathfinder was Nissan's response to the Chevrolet Blazer, Ford Bronco II, Jeep Cherokee, and non-American SUVs like the Toyota 4Runner, Mitsubishi Pajero, and the Isuzu MU.
Before the Pathfinder there was the Nissan Bushmaster (an aftermarket conversion of the Datsun Truck), but they are rare as well. Its optional 4WD system that could be engaged electronically while the vehicle was moving, unique at the time, and a four-speed automatic transmission. All WD21 Pathfinders were available in both 2WD and manually engaged 4WD configurations, with base models installed with a 2.4 L four cylinder engine. In certain countries this generation also came with a 2.7 L I4 Diesel Engine known as the TD27 with the option of a turbocharger installed later in November 1988.
In Japan, it was exclusive to Nissan Bluebird Shop locations, where it was called the Terrano as a smaller companion to the larger Nissan Safari. While the Pathfinder/Terrano was essentially based on the newly introduced Hardbody truck, the rear five link coil suspension was borrowed from the Safari to enhance its off-road abilities. The two door version was installed with the VG30E Nissan V6, that was shared with the Fairlady ZX.
As the Japanese market Terrano was regarded as a luxury vehicle, with an emphasis on outdoor leisure activities, the Terrano was introduced to Japanese buyers as an off-road, back country Fairlady ZX. Ownership costs to Japanese drivers are expensive due to the exterior dimensions exceeding dimension regulations and the engine displacement incurring a higher annual road tax obligation. To emphasize this marketing approach, the Terrano was available with options not normally found on other budget-minded vehicles. Some of the upmarket Japanese-model options were climate-controlled air conditioning, electrically powered windows, seats, door locks, and, in 1993, Recaro seats. Nissan's sports division Autech added special equipment packages, introducing the "Wide R3M Urban" and the "AJ Limited". The emphasis on luxury was partly due to a strong economy in Japan, in what is now regarded as the Japanese "bubble economy".
In 1987, the first generation Terrano was entered in the 9th Paris to Dakar rally race, with continued entries in rally races for many years, winning multiple times in its category.
The four-door Pathfinder was introduced in October 1989 to enhance the Pathfinder's market appeal, but the overall vehicle length and wheelbase were not extended to accommodate the rear doors. At its introduction to North America, 1985 to 1989 Pathfinders came with a two-door body. In early 1990 it became only a four door. Some US 1990 Pathfinders came with the two door body, but they are rare.
When the four door version was introduced, Nissan chose to conceal the door handles as a part of the "C" pillar trim to visually make it appear like a two-door truck with a camper shell, with the conventional door handles on the front doors. This design tradition is still used on all Nissan SUVs currently offered, including the Nissan Armada, Nissan Juke, Nissan Terrano II, and the Nissan Xterra. The front doors were slightly shortened to accommodate the rear doors.
From 1985 to 1989 Pathfinders were available with either the Nissan VG30i 3.0 L V6 (, torque), or the Nissan Z24i 2.4 L () I4 (the same engine choices as the Nissan Hardbody Truck). In 1990 the V6 received an upgrade from throttle body injection to a multi point fuel injection system. This engine was known as the VG30E, and was rated at and torque. Also in 1990, the Z24i was replaced with the KA24E. The first generation continued until 1995.
FACELIFTS
Section::::Facelifts.
A facelift occurred in 1990 when the 4-door model was introduced. The front grille was revised, numerous interior trim level options became available and numerous exterior packages were offered by dealerships. The 1993 models received a third brake light and the 1994 models received a curved dashboard.
SECOND GENERATION R50 SERIES (1996–2004)
Section::::Second generation R50 series (1996–2004).
The second generation Pathfinder was introduced in late 1995 with revised styling using unibody rather than body on frame construction. The engine was upgraded to the VG33E, with and torque. For the 1999½ model year, the Pathfinder was freshened. In 2000, model year 2001 brought a new V6 engine (for the Automatic transmission models). The Manual transmission models boasted and 240-lbft of torque. This engine was the VQ35DE. With its facelift, the Pathfinder also grew in size, making way for the compact Xterra.
Diesel engines continued to be used in Japanese and European models.
As of the 2002 model year, the Terrano / Pathfinder was no longer marketed in Japan, and was available in North America, Europe and the Middle East. The market position held by the Terrano in Japan was replaced by the Nissan Murano in 2002. The Japanese market Terrano and high luxury content Terrano Regulus saw demand drop significantly due to the hard economic times felt in Japan, known as the Lost Decade. Nissan offered a smaller, off-road vehicle to its Japanese customer base who enjoyed the Pathfinder when it introduced the Nissan X-Trail in 2000.

INFINITI QX4/TERRANO REGULUS
Section::::Infiniti QX4/Terrano Regulus.
The Infiniti QX4 is a mid-size luxury SUV introduced in September 1996 and based on the unibody Nissan Pathfinder. It was released following Acura's introduction of the SLX and Lexus's larger LX 450. The QX4 was Infiniti's first entry into the SUV market segment.
Marketed in Japan as the Nissan Terrano Regulus, exclusively in Nissan's JDM Nissan Bluebird Store, the Terrano Regulus was briefly offered at Nissan Motor Store, its luxury-oriented dealership.
