RECEPTION
CRITICAL RESPONSE

Section::::Critical response.
The series has been met with a generally positive response from critics. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an 86% approval rating with an average rating of 7.57 out of 10 based on 70 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, "A meticulously crafted mystery brimming with allusions, Castle Rock is bound to please even the pickiest of Stephen King fans — though mileage may vary for casual viewers." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 66 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Early reviews for the series were generally positive. Colliders Dave Trumbore praised the series saying, "Shaw, Thomason, Abrams & Co. really nail the core concepts of King's storytelling here. Each character gets a good amount of screen time to focus on introspection...Castle Rock is a can't-miss series for Stephen King fans and a must-watch horror show for fans of dark, thrilling, character-focused mysteries." In a similarly favorable critique, Entertainment Weeklys Kristen Baldwin gave the series a grade of "A-" and commended it saying, "Though most characters are new (Scott Glenn's Alan Pangborn, a sheriff who appeared in Needful Things and The Dark Half, is one exception), for King fans the world of Castle Rock will be inescapably familiar. Spending time here feels, in many ways, like coming home — with all of the excitement and dread such a visit entails." In another approving criticism, Ben Travers of Indiewire gave the series a grade of "B+" and complimented it saying, "For a show that could've been dominated by its origins, Castle Rock sure has a good time breathing new life into them. Smart, fun scares; deeply felt, well-founded characters; layers of story to decipher, along with the references — what more could you want in a new piece of the Stephen King library?" In a mixed review, Dan Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the series saying, "The actors will offer the best incentive for the King-ambivalent to tune into Castle Rock, but I'm not sure even they will ultimately be enough to overcome the sluggish and vague story." In a negative review, Daniel D'Addario of Variety was even more disapproving saying, "It's eerie-by-the-numbers, repeatedly telling us quite how scared we ought to be, without yet building characters for whom we feel sympathetic fear."
Among all first season episodes, "The Queen" received particular acclaim from critics with praise being directed towards the writing and Spacek's performance. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode holds a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 9.75 out of 10 based on 14 reviews. The Ringers Miles Surrey referred to the episode as "not only the best episode of the series, but one of the best episodes of television in 2018." Vultures Brian Tallerico awarded the episode a rating of five out of five stars and was similarly enthusiastic saying, "Television doesn't get much more heartbreaking than "The Queen," a showcase for the legendary Sissy Spacek and one of the best hours of television this year." Aiming commendation at the episode's instrumental score, Birth.Movies.Death.s Jacob Knight wrote, "The music in Castle Rock - courtesy of composer Chris Westlake - has been nothing short of exemplary throughout the entire series, but in "The Queen" it practically becomes a character unto itself."
