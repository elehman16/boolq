Section::::History.
Section::::2007–2013.
Sony Crackle was founded as Grouper by Josh Felser, Dave Samuel, Mike Sitrin, and Aviv Eyal in 2004. In August 2006, Sony purchased the online video site Grouper for $65 million. In July 2007, Sony announced that Grouper would be rebranded and repurposed as Crackle, a multi-platform video-entertainment network and studio featuring full-length movies and television shows from Sony's library, and would produce original content made for the internet. In late 2008, San Francisco–based Crackle was moved to Sony's Culver City base to be formally folded into the studio's digital content operations.
In March 2011, Crackle became available for streaming across PS3, Roku boxes, Sony Blu-ray players and Bravia TVs. In April 2011, Crackle announced that it would release apps for iOS and Android systems in June of the same year. Crackle also partnered with Xbox Live, making its content available for Xbox 360. In June 2013, Crackle released an app for the BlackBerry 10 platform. In December 2013, Crackle made its content available for the Apple TV set-top box.
In January 2012, Crackle added Animax to its content, available to viewers in the US and Canada. Towards the end of 2013, the Animax branding was removed. In Australia, Crackle became the free-to-air home of Sony's popular American soap opera Days of Our Lives after the television broadcaster Nine Network axed the series after 45 years.
Several anime shows from Funimation (some outsourced from Animax and others, since November 20, 2013, directly from Funimation) are streamed on Sony Crackle. On July 31, 2017, Sony Pictures Television announced that it would buy a controlling 95% stake in Funimation for $143 million, a deal that was approved by the United States Department of Justice on August 22, 2017, and closed on October 27, 2017. 
2014–2017
Section::::2014–2017.
On April 1, 2014, Sony Pictures Television ceased its Crackle operations in the UK and Australia almost four years after Crackle had expanded into the UK. Crackle UK had struggled to gain a large audience due to other competitors like LoveFilm and Netflix. Two days later, NBCUniversal Television & New Media Distribution struck a multi-year deal with Crackle to have more than 140 of NBCUni's feature films streamed. Crackle shut down its UK service in April 2014 without prior notice.
On April 30, 2014, Crackle announced it would begin carrying Sports Jeopardy!, which as its name implies is a sports-themed version of the syndicated game show Jeopardy!, beginning that fall. Dan Patrick will host the series. Approximately one week after the cancellation of the theatrical release of The Interview, in the aftermath of the Sony hack, the New York Post reported that Sony would release the movie for free, on Crackle.
On April 14, 2015, Crackle held its first-ever upfront presentation. During the event, it announced a new feature dubbed "Always On"; a linear, ad-supported, internet television channel similar to Vevo TV. Among the new programs announced was Crackle's first animated series, SuperMansion; their first hour long scripted drama, The Art of More; and , a sequel to 2001's Joe Dirt being touted as the first ever "made-for-digital" movie sequel.
On June 4, 2015, Crackle announced a new collaboration between Moat and Freewheel in the industry's first-ever comprehensive system to track viewable ad measurement across connected TV.
On October 8, 2015, Crackle premiered SuperMansion, a stop-motion animated comedy television series created by Matthew Senreich and Zeb Wells. The series stars Bryan Cranston, Heidi Gardner, Tucker Gilmore, Keegan-Michael Key, Tom Root, Yvette Nicole Brown, Zeb Wells, and Jillian Bell. Emmy-nominated Season 2 premiered February 16, 2017, followed by an original Halloween special, SuperMansion: Drag Me to Halloween, that premiered October 5. Season 3 is expected in 2018. 
On April 20, 2016, Crackle announced an innovative advertising solution that replaces convention at their upfront presentation called "BreakFree" advertising. The BreakFree experience promotes binge viewing of Crackle's original shows while creating a story narrative for advertisers. In addition, Crackle unveiled a new virtual reality strategy allowing advertisers to reach consumers through dynamic VR experiences. Designed to immerse and engage viewers, Sony's ad-supported streaming service is the first ever AVOD network to provide brands with advertising opportunities and marketing initiatives that take advantage of this latest disruptive technology.
On January 17, 2017, it was announced that Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee would move to Netflix.
On April 19, 2017, the AVOD service released results of new research study that identifies a new and highly coveted psychographic segment called "Connected Entertainment Enthusiasts". This segment is the first generation of gamers who use the game console beyond gaming. It is the preferred entertainment hub of their household for streaming TV, movies and for video games making them hard to reach through traditional media outlets. In addition, Crackle announced a VR companion piece to their original drama series Snatch, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September 2017.
Crackle also announced at the 2017 upfront presentation that the free ad-supported service would greenlight new scripted original drama The Oath, written and created by former Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy Joe Halpin. Executive produced by Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson and his G-Unit Film & Television Inc., the series explores a different kind of subculture—gangs made up of those sworn to protect and defend. The drama stars Sean Bean, Ryan Kwanten, Cory Hardrict, Arlen Escarpeta, Katrina Law, and J.J. Soria. The series premiered March 8, 2018.
In November 2017, Eric Berger was upped to chief digital officer, Sony Pictures Television Networks, in addition to his role as GM, Crackle.
