CRASH (2004 FILM)
Crash is a 2004 American drama film produced, directed, and co-written by Paul Haggis. The film features racial and social tensions in Los Angeles. A self-described "passion piece" for Haggis, Crash was inspired by a real-life incident, in which his Porsche was carjacked in 1991 outside a video store on Wilshire Boulevard.
Several characters' stories interweave during two days in Los Angeles: a black detective estranged from his mother; his criminal younger brother and gang associate; the white district attorney and his irritated, pampered wife; a racist white police officer who disgusts his more idealistic younger partner; an African-American Hollywood director whose wife must deal with the racist officer; a Persian-immigrant father who is wary of others; and a hard-working Hispanic locksmith family man.
The film deals with racism in a rather impartial approach; rather than separating the characters into victims and offenders, victims of racism are often shown to be prejudiced themselves in different contexts and situations; racist remarks and actions are often shown to stem from ignorance and misconception rather than malice.
The film features an ensemble cast, including Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, William Fichtner, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, Thandie Newton, Michael Peña, and Ryan Phillippe. Matt Dillon was particularly praised for his performance and received Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor. Additionally, the cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. The film received six Academy Award nominations, and won three for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Film Editing at the 78th Academy Awards. It was also nominated for nine BAFTA awards, and won two, for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Thandie Newton.
PLOT
Section::::Plot.
The movie begins with Detective Graham Waters, Don Cheadle, and his partner Ria, Jennifer Esposito, being involved in a minor collision with a car being driven by Kim Lee, Alexis Rhee. A subsequent exchange of racially charged insults occurs. The next time we see Waters he is arriving at a crime scene where the body of a "dead kid" has been discovered." We then jump to Farhad, a Persian shop owner, and his daughter Dorri in a gun shop arguing over what bullets they should buy. The gun store owner grows impatient and degrades the two of them by referring to Farhad as "Osama." Farhad is then commanded to leave the store and Dorri becomes responsible for the choice. The next scene depicts two black men, Anthony, Ludacris, and Peter, carjacking District Attorney Rick and his wife Jean, played by Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock. Later, at the couple's house, Hispanic locksmith Michael Peña overhears Jean degrading him for his tattoos and dress.
John Ryan, Matt Dillon, and his partner Tom Hansen, Ryan Phillippe, later pull over an SUV being driven by director Cameron Thayer, Terrence Howard, and his wife Christine, Thandie Newton. After mouthing off, Christine is sexually assaulted by Ryan under the auspices of a pat-down. 
In the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter hit a Korean man while passing a parked van, dump him in front of a hospital, and drive away. Daniel's next call is to replace a lock at Farhad's shop but when Daniel warns Farhad that the real problem is the door, Farhad won't listen. The next day Farhad finds that his store has been wrecked and defaced with graffiti. Waters visits his hard drug-abusing mother, who asks him to find his missing younger brother.
Ryan comes across a car accident and as he crawls into the overturned vehicle, he finds Christine trapped. Although she resists frantically at first, with the help of his partner and spectators, Ryan pulls the terrified Christine out just as her car bursts into flames. Anthony and Peter carjack another navigator which happens to be Cameron's. Only after opening the door do they realize that Cameron is black. Police officers arrive on the scene and there is a chase that ends with Cameron and Anthony in Cameron's car on a dead end residential road. Hansen is one of the pursuing officers and vouches for Cameron because of the part he played in the assault of Cameron's wife.
Farhad locates Daniel's house and waits in ambush but as he confronts Daniel and shoots Daniel's daughter jumps into Daniel's arms, attempting to protect her father. Everyone watches in horror as Daniel clutches his daughter but they soon realize that she has not been shot and the family retreats inside. Farhad later tells his daughter that he believes the little girl was his guardian angel, preventing him from committing a terrible crime. Dorri is then shown with the box of blanks she had purchased.
Hansen pulls over to pick up a hitchhiking Peter although throughout the drive Hansen becomes more and more suspicious of Peter's intentions. Peter offends Hansen by suddenly beginning to laugh and when Peter reaches for his pocket Hansen shoots. In Peter's hand is a statuette similar to the one on Hansen's dash and, horrified, Hansen hides the body in some nearby bushes and burns his car. Waters arrives at the scene with his partner and the connection is made that Peter is his missing brother and the "dead boy". Later, at the morgue, Dorri is revealed to be the coroner. 
Anthony decides to steal the van of the Korean man he accidentally hit and, when he drops it off at a chop shop he frequents, he discovers a number of Cambodian immigrants locked in the back of the van. The chop shop owner offers him $500 per immigrant but Anthony has other plans. He is seen driving into Chinatown and setting the Cambodian people free, passing a car crash on his way out.

RELEASE
BOX OFFICE
Section::::Release.
Section::::Box office.
Crash opened in wide release on May 6, 2005, and was a box office success in the late spring of 2005. The film had a budget of $6.5 million (plus $1 million in financing). Because of the financial constraints, director Haggis filmed in his own house, borrowed a set from the TV show Monk, used his car in parts of the film, and even used cars from other staff members. The film grossed $53.4 million domestically, making back more than seven times its budget. Despite its success in relation to its cost, Crash was the lowest-grossing film at the domestic box office to win Best Picture since The Last Emperor in 1987.
CRITICAL RESPONSE
Section::::Critical response.
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 236 reviews, with an average score of 7.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "A raw and unsettling morality piece on modern angst and urban disconnect, Crash examines the dangers of bigotry and xenophobia in the lives of interconnected Angelenos." On Metacritic the film has a score of 69 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". According to CinemaScore, audiences gave the film a grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale.
Roger Ebert gave the film 4/4 stars and described it as "a movie of intense fascination", listing it as the best film of 2005. The film also ranks at #460 in Empires 2008 poll of the "500 Greatest Films of All Time".
Some later reviews of Crash have been less favorable. Cultural critic Ta-Nehisi Coates criticized the film as shallow and "unthinking," naming Crash "the worst film of the decade." The film has been critiqued for depicting the Persian shopkeeper as a "deranged, paranoid individual who is only redeemed by what he believes is a mystical act of God." The film has also been criticized for using multicultural and sentimentalist imagery to cover over material and "historically sedimented inequalities" that continue to affect different racial groups in Los Angeles.
In 2010, the Independent Film & Television Alliance selected Crash as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years.
OSCAR CONTROVERSY
Section::::Oscar controversy.
Crash won the Best Picture Oscar at the 78th Academy Awards, controversially beating the critically favored Brokeback Mountain and making it only the second film ever (the other being The Sting) to win the Academy Award for Best Picture without having been nominated for any of the three Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture (Best Drama, Best Comedy/Musical and Best Foreign Film).
The film's use of moral quandary as a storytelling medium was widely reported as ironic, since many saw it as the "safe" alternative to Brokeback Mountain, the plot of which focused on gay cowboys. Critic Kenneth Turan suggested that Crash benefited from anti-gay discomfort among Academy members, while critic Roger Ebert was of a different opinion, arguing that the better film won that year. Ebert also questioned why many critics were not acknowledging the other nominees, claiming that they were criticizing Crash's win solely because it won over their preferred film.
Film Comment magazine placed Crash first on their list of "Worst Winners of Best Picture Oscars", followed by Slumdog Millionaire at #2, and Chicago at #3. Similarly, a 2014 survey of film critics by The Atlantic identified the film's victory as among the most glaring mistakes made by the Academy Awards.
In 2015, The Hollywood Reporter polled hundreds of Academy members, asking them to re-vote on past controversial decisions. For the 2006 Best Picture winner, Brokeback Mountain beat Crash and the other nominees.
In a 2015 interview, Paul Haggis commented : "Was [Crash] the best film of the year? I don't think so. There were great films that year. Good Night, and Good Luck – amazing film. Capote – terrific film. Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain, great film. And Spielberg's Munich. I mean please, what a year. Crash, for some reason, affected people, it touched people. And you can't judge these films like that. I'm very glad to have those Oscars. They're lovely things. But you shouldn't ask me what the best film of the year was because I wouldn't be voting for Crash, only because I saw the artistry that was in the other films. Now however, for some reason that's the film that touched people the most that year. So I guess that's what they voted for, something that really touched them. And I'm very proud of the fact that Crash does touch you. People still come up to me more than any of my films and say: 'That film just changed my life.' I've heard that dozens and dozens and dozens of times. So it did its job there. I mean, I knew it was the social experiment that I wanted, so I think it's a really good social experiment. Is it a great film? I don't know".
