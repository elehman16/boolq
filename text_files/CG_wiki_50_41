BEAUTY MARK
A beauty mark or beauty spot is a euphemism for a type of dark facial mole, so named because such birthmarks are sometimes considered an attractive feature. Medically, such "beauty marks" are generally melanocytic nevus, more specifically the compound variant. Moles of this type may also be located elsewhere on the body, and may also be considered beauty marks if located on the face, shoulder, neck or breast. Artificial beauty marks have been fashionable in some periods.
ARTIFICIAL BEAUTY MARK
Section::::Artificial beauty mark.
Artificial beauty marks became fashionable in sixteenth-century France, and the fashion persisted into the eighteenth century, applied to the face as a form of make-up. They were often in fanciful shapes such as hearts or stars. Besides their decorative value, they could hide smallpox scars or syphilis sores. They could be purchased as silk or velvet patches known as "mouches" (flies). Alexander Pope's 1712 poem The Rape of the Lock mentions such patches as indicators of "secular love":
Here Files of Pins extend their shining Rows,
Puffs, Powders, Patches, Bibles, Billet-doux.
Now awful Beauty puts on all its Arms;
The Fair each moment rises in her Charms,
Repairs her Smiles, awakens ev'ry Grace,
And calls forth all the Wonders of her Face;
The fashion spread to Spain and the Spanish Empire in the eighteenth century, under the name chiqueador.
Natural beauty marks are also often enhanced with color from an eyebrow pencil or pen.
The Monroe piercing has gained popularity in recent years as a flexible way of approximating a beauty mark.
