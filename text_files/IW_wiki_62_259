RECEPTION
Section::::Reception.
Gary Goldstein, of the Los Angeles Times, said: "The edgy coming-of-age tale Ask Me Anything begins with a snarky, bubble-gum vibe that gives way to something far deeper and more meaningful." Adding that it "masterfully immerses us into the life of a floundering teenager with often-stirring, unexpected results." As for the film's surprising, unique ending, he added "It's all beautifully paid off in the movie's haunting coda."
