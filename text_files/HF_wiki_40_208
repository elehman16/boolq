HISTORY
Section::::History.
Co-Founders "Beaver" Aplin and Don Wasek opened the first store, which is still open as of 2017, in Lake Jackson, Texas in 1982. Aplin formed the name Buc-ee's by combining his childhood nickname; the name of his Labrador Retriever, Buck; as well as the appeal of Ipana toothpaste's animated mascot, Bucky the beaver.
Buc-ee's expanded and opened their first travel center in Luling, Texas in 2001. Buc-ee's are large stores (no 18 wheelers allowed) with fuel pumps that range from 80-120 fueling positions for gas and diesel (some stores include Ethanol Free and DEF) and a huge selection of beef jerky, pastries, fresh sandwiches, tacos, Dippin' Dots and homemade fudge.
In 2012, Buc-ee's opened its largest travel center in New Braunfels, Texas on Interstate 35. The New Braunfels location is the largest convenience store in the world at 68,000 square feet. The store features 120 fueling positions, 83 toilets, 31 cash registers, 4 Icee machines, and 80 fountain dispensers. It also offers tubing and water gear for enjoying the nearby Guadalupe River.
The New Braunfels, Texas store was named the 2012 "Best Restroom in America" by Cintas.
The first Buc-ee's in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex opened in Terrell, Texas on June 22, 2015. The travel center is located three miles west of Tanger Outlets on Interstate 20 (no 18 wheelers allowed).
In September 2015 it was announced that at least part of Buc-ee's corporate operations would move to office space at Pearland Town Center. The "partial headquarters" would house legal and human resources departments of the company. The space was to be ready by the early part of 2016, but it is not known whether Buc-ee's went through with having the Pearland office space, or not.
The second Buc-ee's in the Metroplex opened on May 23, 2016. The store is located in far northern Fort Worth, across the street from Texas Motor Speedway. The third DFW location opened in Denton, Texas on October 29th, 2018
On March 8, 2016, Buc-ee's announced a possible first location outside of the state of Texas would be located in Baton Rouge, LA. The location was expected to open in early 2017, however, on October 4, 2016, Buc-ee's announced that the plans for the Baton Rouge location had been terminated.
On April 12, 2017, Buc-ee's announced that it will open their first convenience store/gas station outside of Texas in Daytona Beach, Florida. It will be located on the north side of LPGA Boulevard across from Tanger Outlets, just east of Interstate 95 and immediately west of Stonewood Grill & Tavern (formerly Vince Carter's). At 50,000 square feet with 120 fueling positions the Daytona Beach travel center will be the largest in Florida and the largest outside of Texas. Construction is slated to start summer 2018.
In January 2018, Buc-ee's broke ground on a second out of Texas location in Baldwin County Alabama, At 50,000 square feet with 120 gas pumps, it will be the second Buc-ee's to be built outside of Texas and the first in Alabama. A few weeks after the Baldwin County location began construction, Buc-ee's announced that a second Southern Alabama location will be built in Mobile. 
Buc-ee's broke ground on another North-Texas location in Melissa, Texas on Monday, February 5, 2018. The store is located off New Davis Road and U.S. Highway 75. The store is expected to open in February 2019.
In June 2018, Buc-ee's approached landowners in Texarkana, Texas with interest in acreage off Interstate 30 and State Line Ave., for a future store site. The company has the option to buy the property, but as of yet, has not exercised that option.
Buc-ee's announced in late 2018, a deal with Tooshlights to put special indicator lights in bathrooms to alert customers to which stalls are occupied or not. This is similar to the indicator lights used at some parking facilities that tell drivers which parking spaces are available and which are not. The Katy and Temple Buc-ee's stores would be the first to get the special bathroom indicator lights.
PRODUCTS

Buc-ee's offers products found at most convenience stores such as fuel, cigarettes, tobacco, chips, drinks, and soft drinks at their smaller neighborhood stores.

LAWSUITS
Section::::Lawsuits.
In recent years, during the company's rapidly growing success, Buc-ee's has filed numerous lawsuits against other convenience store chains, most of them based out of Texas, for alleged trademark and trade dress infringement.
In 2014, Buc-ee's filed a lawsuit against Texas based convenience store chain "Frio Beaver. Frio Beaver, a company with a logo also depicting a beaver in a yellow circle with a black outline, was accused of copying the iconic Buc-ee's beaver head logo, which the company is widely known for in Texas.
In 2016, Buc-ee's sued "Choke Canyon BBQ", another Texas convenience store, for copyright infringement and trade dressing. Choke Canyon uses a logo of a grinning alligator in the middle of a yellow circle, which Buc-ee's claims is an attempt by the chain to resemble the Buc-ee's logo. Choke Canyon is also calling their new stores "Bucky's", and practically duplicating the look of the inside of a Buc-ee's store. 
In 2017, Buc-ee's again filed a lawsuit for breaking an agreement, this time against a Nebraska-based convenience store chain known as "Bucky's". The two companies had agreed to remain in their respective states and expand only to states where the other did not operate. 
There was also a non-logo related lawsuit filed in 2013 against "Chicks", a convenience store located in Bryan, Texas, for trade dressing by allegedly copying Buc-ee's mega convenience store designs and layout. The case was settled out of court.
Buc-ee's also lost a Texas Employee Rentention Agreement Case on an appeal in 2017. A year after a trial court ordered a former employee pay Buc-ee's close to $100,000 in damages and attorney's fees for breaching an "Retention Agreement," a Texas court of appeals reversed the decision and ordered that Buc-ee's take nothing on its claims against the former employee. The court reasoned that the contract violated Texas' employment-at-will doctrine. It could only be valid if it met the requirements of an actual non-compete agreement, but as this did not meet Texas requirement for non-compete, the contract was not enforceable.
ADVERTISING
Section::::Advertising.
