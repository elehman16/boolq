PRODUCTION
Section::::Production.
In October 2016, Jarratt suggested that Wolf Creek would be returning for a second season and a later film. Stan officially announced that Wolf Creek had been renewed in February 2017 and would be released in late 2017. Filming began in South Australia in July 2017. The six-episode second season sees John Jarratt reprise his role as Mick Taylor, alongside new cast members Tess Haubrich, Matt Day, Ben Oxenbould, Laura Wheelwright, Stephen Hunter and Chris Haywood. The story centres around Taylor meeting a coach full of international tourists â€“ a complete departure from the first season's storyline which sees the show become an anthology style program, and won't see Fry reprise her role as Eve Thorogood. The second season was released on 15 December 2017.
Greg McLean is returning as showrunner and director, along with Kieran Darcy-Smith and Geoff Bennett. Lisa Scott and Kerrie Mainwaring are producers for the series. Executive producers are Rory Callaghan, Greg Haddrick, Greg McLean, Nick Forward and Rob Gibson. Writers on the series are Nick Parsons, Shanti Gudgeon and Mark Dapin.
