INTERSTATE 78 IN PENNSYLVANIA
Interstate 78 (I-78) is an east–west route stretching from Union Township in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania to New York City. In the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, I-78 runs for about 77 miles (124 km), from the western terminus at Interstate 81 in Union Township, Lebanon County to the New Jersey state line near Easton, Northampton County.
ROUTE DESCRIPTION
Section::::Route description.
I-78 starts in Pennsylvania at an interchange with Interstate 81. It merges with U.S. Route 22 in Lebanon County, with the median strip becoming narrow at that point; the two run together for from Bethel Township to Kuhnsville. Near Hamburg at exit 29, the highway meets Pennsylvania Route 61. At exit 51 near Kuhnsville, US 22 splits off from I-78 and becomes the Lehigh Valley Thruway. At exit 53, Pennsylvania Route 309 merges with I-78 for . Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom is visible from the freeway approaching exit 54 for U.S. Route 222, which leads to the park. In Summit Lawn, State Route 309 leaves the freeway toward Quakertown at exit 60, with prior exit 59 providing access to Pennsylvania Route 145. Past Allentown and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania Route 33 meets I-78 at exit 71, providing access to the Pocono Mountains to the north. The last exit in Pennsylvania is Exit 75/Morgan Hill Road, which connects to Pennsylvania Route 611. The Interstate crosses the Delaware River on the Interstate 78 Toll Bridge, leaving Pennsylvania for New Jersey. Tolls are only required on the westbound side, coming into Pennsylvania.
NAMES
Section::::Names.

HISTORY
Section::::History.
Construction of the freeway between Lebanon and Lehigh counties took place between 1950 and 1970, originally as an upgraded alignment of US 22. The entire freeway was completed by 1989. When the Interstate Highway System numbers were first assigned in 1957, the route was planned as I-80N. Prior to the late 1960s, I-78 was to be routed on the Lehigh Valley Thruway across to Phillipsburg, New Jersey, continuing the concurrency with US Route 22; however, because of heavy opposition by residents of Phillipsburg, PennDOT and NJDOT opted to build the new southerly alignment on which I-78 is routed today.
INTERSTATE 178
Section::::Interstate 178.
Interstate 178 was a proposed spur from Interstate 78, but was cancelled because the Liberty Bell Shrine was in the path of the proposed expressway. Additionally, locals opposed the destruction of Sixth and Seventh Streets to accommodate the highway. The planned northern terminus would have been between the 15th Street and PA 145 interchanges. If built, Interstate 178 would have connected US 22, formerly designated I-78 into Allentown.
This route was shown in Rand McNally atlases in the late 1960s, but was not included in the 1971 federal interstate route log. The route was supposed to end near Muhlenberg College.
INTERSTATE 378
Section::::Interstate 378.
Interstate 378 was the designation for a spur route that would extend from Interstate 78 into Bethlehem. At the time, I-78 was designated as the Lehigh Valley Thruway, concurrent with US 22, and the route numbering made sense. Unlike I-178, the route was built. When I-78 was later redirected south of this area, I-378 had no direct connection to I-78 and therefore was downgraded to state route status. The route still remains, as a freeway with exits and their own numbers.
When Interstate 178 and 378 were planned (and 378 was built), I-78 ran the length of the Lehigh Valley Thruway. Later, I-78 was rerouted onto a bypass route south of the Thruway. This was due to opposition to continue the concurrency with the Thruway into New Jersey.
IMPROVING I-78
Section::::Improving I-78.
In 2013, PennDOT announced plans to improve a portion of I-78 in eastern Berks County. The project will redesign the PA 737 interchange, add truck lanes, and raise the height of three overpasses. Construction is expected to begin in 2015 with completion in 2018.
