PRODUCTION
Section::::Production.
The show is set at a modest waterfront resort at Lake of the Ozarks, inspired by the Alhonna Resort and Marina, where series creator Dubuque worked as a dock hand while attending college in Missouri during the 1980s. Most of the shooting locations are in the Atlanta area at Lake Allatoona and Lake Lanier, rather than at the Lake of the Ozarks, because of tax breaks offered by the state of Georgia. The film crew constructed a set in Georgia after extensively studying the Alhonna Resort property. Some scenes are filmed at Chicago locations. Only a few scenes of the pilot were shot in the city of Lake Ozark, Missouri; these include shots of the locally famous "Welcome To Lake Of the Ozarks" sign and the "Injun Joe Muffler Man" statue. Originally, Jason Bateman was supposed to be the sole director for the first season, but scheduling conflicts prevented it, so he directed only the first two and last two. The series was renewed for a 10-episode second season on August 15, 2017.
OPENING CREDITS
Section::::Opening credits.
Graphic designer Fred Davis created a white letter 'O', which is featured on a black background at the beginning of each episode. Within the quartered circle of the 'O' are four symbols which foreshadow the main plot points in that episode. Additionally, each of these hand-drawn symbolic images are formed to represent the remaining letters in "Ozark". For example, for episode one, a kneeling man represents "Z"; a building represents "A"; a gun represents "R"; and a falling man represents "K".

Section::::Critical response.
Section::::Season 1.
The first season of Ozark received positive reviews, with praise for Bateman's performance. On Metacritic, the season has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a approval rating of 68%, with an average rating of 6.84/10 based on 63 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, "Ozark hasn't yet reached the same level as the classic crime dramas to which it will inevitably be compared, but its satisfyingly complex plot – and a gripping performance from Jason Bateman – suggest greater potential."
Brian Lowry of CNN wrote, "While the fish-out-of-water concept is one of TV's oldest, Ozark carves out its own path with clever twists—including a late-in-the-run flashback explaining how the cartel came into his life—and the sheer strength of the performances." TV critic Sonia Saraiya of Variety wrote that Ozark is "smart, well-crafted, and says something," and that the series "comes together under Bateman's disarming and deceptively complex performance as Marty." Tim Dowling of The Guardian wrote "Laura Linney is, as ever, magnificent".
Critics compared Ozark positively to Breaking Bad, both of which involve a seemingly normal protagonist suddenly immersed in a world of crime. Nick Hanover wrote in Film Daily, "Once you get past the surface similarities, Ozark shines as something special and inventive, an intense crime opera where the scenery is as much the star as anyone in the cast."
SEASON 2
Section::::Season 2.
The second season received mixed reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the season has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 72%, with an average rating of 6.5/10, based on 36 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, "Engaging and entertaining – if not particularly challenging – Ozarks descent into darker waters is kept afloat by another superb turn from Laura Linney." Alison Foreman of Mashable noted how the female characters are not just "emotional fodder" for the male characters, stating "Season 2 of Netflix's Ozark, however, champions female stories through all 10 of its episodes with an array of women that rivals the ensemble complexity of HBO's The Sopranos."
