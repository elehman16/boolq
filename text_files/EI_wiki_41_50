LIST OF ROSEANNE EPISODES
Roseanne is an American television sitcom that was originally broadcast on ABC from October 18, 1988, to May 20, 1997 with a revival season that premiered in 2018. Lauded for its realistic portrayal of the average American family, the series stars Roseanne Barr, and revolves around the Conners, an Illinois working-class family. In the ninth season, Roseanne and family win the lottery and thus associate with "high society". In the final episode Roseanne reveals not only was she writing a story and they did not really win the lottery, but also says Dan had actually passed away from a heart attack in season 8.
In season 10 it is revealed that Dan did not die - Roseanne fabricated that as well, along with a multitude of other things; this set most things back as they were in season 8. Barr said the lottery storyline was done to illustrate the American Dream philosophy. 
On May 16, 2017, it was announced ABC would produce an eight-episode 10th season revival of the series, set to air as a mid-season replacement in 2018, with the original cast returning. In November 2017, it was announced that ABC had ordered an additional episode for the new season bringing the total up to 9. The tenth season debuted on March 27, 2018. On March 30, 2018, the series was renewed for an eleventh season of 13 episodes by ABC, but was canceled on May 29, 2018 due to a controversial joke made by Roseanne on Twitter about Obama aide Valerie Jarrett.
On June 21, 2018, the show was revived as a spinoff entitled The Conners, which has the same cast as Roseanne after her character dies of a drug overdose. The show premiered on October 16, 2018 and will have 10 episodes.
