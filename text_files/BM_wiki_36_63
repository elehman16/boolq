SCHOOL OF ROCK
School of Rock is a 2003 comedy film directed by Richard Linklater, produced by Scott Rudin, and written by Mike White. The film stars Jack Black, Joan Cusack, White, and Sarah Silverman. Black plays struggling rock guitarist Dewey Finn, who is kicked out of his band and subsequently disguises himself as a substitute teacher at a prestigious prep school. After witnessing the musical talent of his students, Dewey forms a band of fourth-graders to attempt to win the upcoming Battle of the Bands and pay off his rent.
School of Rock was released on October 3, 2003, by Paramount Pictures, grossing $131 million worldwide on a $35 million budget. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Black's performance. It was the highest grossing music-themed comedy of all time, until it was overtaken in 2015 by Pitch Perfect 2. A stage musical adaptation opened on Broadway in December 2015, and a television adaptation for Nickelodeon premiered on March 12, 2016.
PLOT
Section::::Plot.
No Vacancy, a rock band, performs at a nightclub three weeks before auditioning for a Battle of the Bands competition. Guitarist Dewey Finn performs on-stage antics, including a failed stage dive that abruptly ends the performance. The next morning, Dewey wakes in the apartment he lives in with Ned Schneebly and his girlfriend, Patty DiMarco. They inform him he must make up for his share of the rent or move out. When he meets No Vacancy at a rehearsal session, he finds out that he has been replaced by another guitarist named Spider. Later, while attempting to sell some of his equipment for rent money, Dewey answers a phone call from Rosalie "Ros" Mullins, the principal of the Horace Green prep school, inquiring for Ned about a short-term position as a substitute teacher. Desperate for money, Dewey impersonates Ned and is hired. On his first day at the school, Dewey adopts the name "Mr. S" as he is unable to spell 'Schneebly', and spends his first day behaving erratically, much to the class's confusion.
The next day, Dewey overhears a music class and devises a plan to form them into a new band to audition for Battle of the Bands. He casts Zack Mooneyham as lead guitarist, Freddy Jones as drummer, cello player Katie on bass, Lawrence on keyboard, and himself as lead vocalist and guitarist. He assigns the rest of the class to various roles of backup singers, groupies, roadies and security, with Summer Hathaway as band manager. The project takes over normal lessons, but helps the students to embrace their talents and overcome their problems. He reassures Lawrence, who feels nerdy, and is worried about not being cool enough for the band; Zack, whose overbearing father disapproves of rock; and Tomika, an overweight girl who is too self-conscious even to audition for backup singer, despite having an amazing voice. During one eloquent lesson, he teaches the kids that rock and roll is the way to "Stick it to the Man" and stand up for themselves.
Two weeks into his hiring, Dewey sneaks his key band members out of school to audition for a spot in the Battle of the Bands competition, while the rest of the class stay behind to maintain cover. When Freddy wanders off to be with other much older musicians, Dewey retrieves him and chastises him for doing so. Unfortunately, the group is rejected as the bill is full. However; Summer comes up with a plan to trick the organizers into thinking that the band is made up entirely of terminally ill children. The plan works, and the band is set to play. The next day, band "groupies" Michelle and Eleni, with Summer's approval, pitch the band name "The School of Rock". Almost immediately afterwards Ros decides to check on Dewey's teaching progress, forcing Dewey to teach the actual material. Ros explains that a parents' night will take place at the school the day before Battle of the Bands, rendering Dewey somewhat concerned.
As Dewey prepares for the parents' night, Ned receives a paycheck from the school via mail and realizes that Dewey has been impersonating him. During the parents' meeting, the parents question what Dewey has been teaching the kids until Ned, Patty and the police confront Dewey. With Ros bursting in to question what is going on, Dewey reveals his true identity, admits he is not a licensed teacher and flees to his apartment where he and Patty later argue. Ned intervenes to break up the argument. Dewey apologizes to Ned and admits he cannot give up music. Understanding, Ned opens up to Dewey, stating that he misses his old life being part of a rock band called Maggot Death, and explains that he chose to move on with his life after realizing that it was not becoming the career he had hoped it would be. Ned suggests that Dewey should move out.
The next morning, the parents chastise Ros in her office while the kids decide to not let their hard work go to waste and to sneak out of the school. When the new substitute discovers that they are missing, she informs Ros, who determines that they have gone to the competition. A school bus with the kids comes to pick up Dewey, then takes them to the Battle of the Bands competition where they decide to play the song written by Zack earlier in the film. Initially dismissed as a gimmick, the band wins over the crowd. However, much to Dewey's dismay, his old band which he was kicked out of earlier 'No Vacancy' wins. During this announcement, the audience chants "School of Rock", demanding an encore. The band retakes the stage and begins performing It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll) by AC/DC.
Meanwhile, in the audience Ned, Ros, and all of the children's parents have arrived. They are impressed and proud of Dewey and the band, much to the dismay of Patty, whom Ned breaks up with.
Some time later, an after-school program known as the School of Rock has opened. We see Dewey continuing to coach the students he previously played with, while Ned teaches beginner students.

PRODUCTION
Section::::Production.
Screenwriter Mike White's concept for the film was inspired by the Langley Schools Music Project. Jack Black once witnessed a stage dive gone wrong involving Ian Astbury of rock band The Cult, which made its way into the film. Many scenes from the movie were shot around the New York City area. The school portrayed in School of Rock is actually Main Hall at Wagner College in Staten Island, New York. In the DVD commentary, the kids say that all of the hallway scenes were shot in one hallway. One of the theaters used in many of the shots was at Union County Performing Arts Center located in Rahway, New Jersey.
MUSIC
SOUNDTRACK
Section::::Music.
Section::::Soundtrack.
The eponymous album was released on September 30, 2003. Sammy James Jr. of the band The Mooney Suzuki penned the title track with screenwriter Mike White, and the band backed up Jack Black and the child musicians on the soundtrack recording of the song. The film's director, Richard Linklater, scouted the country for talented 13-year-old musicians to play the rock and roll music featured on the soundtrack and in the film. The soundtrack includes "Immigrant Song" by Led Zeppelin, a band that has rarely granted permission for use of their songs in film and television. Linklater came up with the idea to shoot a video on the stage used at the end of the film, with Jack Black begging the band for permission with the crowd extras cheering and chanting behind him. The video was sent directly to the living members of Led Zeppelin, and permission was granted for the song. The video is included on the DVD.

In 2008, Jack Black said that a sequel was being considered. It was later reported that director Richard Linklater and producer Scott Rudin would return. Mike White was returning as screenwriter for the sequel, titled School of Rock 2: America Rocks, which picks up with Finn leading a group of summer school students on a cross-country field trip that delves into the history of rock 'n' roll. In 2012, Black stated that he believed the sequel was unlikely, saying, "I tried really hard to get all the pieces together. I wouldn't want to do it without the original writer and director, and we never all got together and saw eye-to-eye on what the script would be. It was not meant to be, unfortunately," but added, "never say never".
