CHOCOLATE BHUTLAH
The Chocolate Bhutlah is a strain of chili pepper, originally created by Chad Soleski. The variety was made by accident, via an unintentional cross-pollination. The mother plant was the Red Bhutlah, which is a cross between the Trinidad Douglah (also known as the 7 pot/pod douglah or 7 pod brown), and bhut jolokia (ghost pepper). It's unknown from which variety they were crossed. Chad Soleski gave these cross-pollinated seeds for the Red Bhutlah to Steven Mclaurin, who grew them out and discovered the chocolate-colored pods. A large specimen was sent to, and reviewed by, Ted Barrus, which caused a sensation in the chili pepper community; that it could be the next hottest pepper in the world.
Though its Scoville rating has not yet been determined (due to the instability of the pepper), many chili reviewers have said that it is hotter than the Carolina Reaper, the current world record holder. The chocolate bhutlah is a large chili, typically with a blistered exterior, and has a floral taste.
