EARLY HISTORY OF RCM FOREIGN CIRCULATION
Section::::Early history of RCM foreign circulation.
In 1970, Master of the Mint, Gordon Ward Hunter relaunched the Foreign Circulation division. In January 1970, the RCM won a contract for Singapore to produce six million rimmed blanks in a copper nickel alloy. This was their first export contract since a contract for the Dominican Republic 32 years earlier. The second contract came in April 1970 with the Central Bank of Brazil. The RCM produced 84 million blanks for the 50 centavo piece. In August 1971, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen placed an order for 2 million five fil pieces. This was followed by an order from Iceland for 2.5 million one crown pieces. 
In October 1971, the Bank of Jamaica asked the RCM to produce a commemorative ten dollar coin in sterling silver, and a twenty dollar gold coin of proof quality. Also in 1971, the RCM made coins for the Bahamas, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, and the Isle of Man. An order for 100 million general circulation five centime and ten centimo coins for Venezuela was received as well. By 1973, orders totaled sixty five million coins, and seventy million blanks. By 1974, the Ottawa facility produced a total of 1.2 billion coins (foreign and domestic), a facility record.
