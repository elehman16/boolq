REC-90
REC-90 is an ethanol-free, 90 octane unleaded gasoline blend designed for use in recreational/marine engines which can be damaged by the ethanol found in other gasoline blends. It is also usable in some aviation engines  and automotive engines, though it has not been thoroughly tested for cars and trucks.
Unlike most stations in the plains states which carry ethanol-free 87 octane unleaded alongside 10% ethanol 87 octane unleaded, many states carry ethanol-free gasoline specifically marketed as recreational fuel designed for marine equipment and small engines.

As debate has ensued over ethanol blending in gasolines, ethanol-free has popped up in a number of states marketed as Rec-90 Recreational Gasoline. Because there is no cheap oxygenate in Rec-90 gasoline, Rec-90 is almost always significantly more expensive per gallon than E10 "Regular Gasoline".
According to the crowd-sourced website e85prices.com, , there are several dozen stations known in the United States to carry ethanol-free fuel. The following is a table listing the number of known stations in each state to carry ethanol-free fuel.
