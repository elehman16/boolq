EUSTON SQUARE TUBE STATION
Euston Square is a London Underground station at the corner of Euston Road and Gower Street, just north of University College London and within walking distance of Euston railway station. It is between Great Portland Street and King's Cross St. Pancras on the Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines, in Travelcard Zone 1.
HISTORY
Section::::History.
The station was opened as "Gower Street" on 10 January 1863 by the Metropolitan Railway (MR) the world's first underground railway. In 1864, the North Western and Charing Cross Railway received parliamentary authorisation for a line between Euston and Charing Cross connecting to the mainline companies at each end. Following a renaming to the London Central Railway (LCR) in 1870, the company was authorised in 1871 to build a station on the north side of the MR's tunnel. This would have provided an interchange between the two railways; however, the LCR was unable to raise funding for construction of its line and the scheme was abandoned in 1874.
The station was given its present name on 1 November 1909. In late 2006 the new entrance on the south side of Euston Road opened in a corner of the new headquarters of the Wellcome Trust replacing the old entrance. There is also a subway entrance on the north side of Euston Road. In 2011, two new lifts linking the westbound platform to the street were opened. On top of these a new modern entrance was opened.
FUTURE
Section::::Future.
In December 2005, Network Rail announced plans to create a subway link between the station and Euston station as part of the re-development of Euston station. This will create a direct link for users of main line rail services which depart from Euston. These plans would also be pursued during a rebuilding for High Speed 2.
