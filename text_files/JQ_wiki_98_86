PLOT
Section::::Plot.
The story begins with an old grandmother telling her two granddaughters the story of The Little Mermaid. Despite their young ages, the girls don't believe in the story, until their grandmother tells them a tale of a girl she knew who met a mermaid. Many years ago, a young reporter named Cam Harrison who had failed to earn a living sets out in search of a good story accompanied by his young niece, Elle. There, they go to a circus and encounter a beautiful mermaid trapped in a glass tank. They are further amazed when the mermaid appears before them as a young woman with legs. The duo soon learn of a prophecy about a little girl born on land but blessed with the heart of a mermaid. With this prophecy come to life in Elle, they are further entangled in a sinister plot of a wizard who wishes to keep the mermaid's soul and convert it to power.
Cam Harrison is writing a letter while Elle is outside playing with friends. The letter addresses her as his niece and notes that her condition has no cure, but does lead Elle to believe she is a mermaid. She experiences an episode of coughing and is carried inside by Cam who then gives Elle some medicine. Cam is then seen arriving at work and is given an assignment by his boss to investigate Dr. Locke's mermaid cure-all healing water as there have been more testimonies than most hoaxes and may contain a cure for his niece.
Cam and Elle arrive in Mississippi via train and come to Lorene's home where she shows them around. The trio then venture to the grocery store where they meet Peggy Gene, a woman who has been healed by the mermaid water. The women and Cam discuss having other patients meet him at the church. While at the church interviewing these people, it is revealed that none of them have actually been cured of their ailments (the deaf man has trouble hearing Cam, the man with migraines still suffers headaches, and Peggy Gene is still eccentric).
Cam and Elle then visit the circus, meeting the fortune teller who warns Cam of keeping his most precious treasure close as someone may attempt to take it. They then meet the mermaid who is floating in a tank. After this, Elle begs to ride the Ferris Wheel and goes alone while Cam stays on the ground. He bumps into Locke and the mermaid, but is then distracted by Elle's return.
The two then take a walk in the woods, presumably the following day, and meet the mermaid again. Elle questions the mermaid about her ability to walk and it is explained that mermaids are able to walk on legs when it is low tide. The mermaid introduces herself as Elizabeth. Locke is then shown with her soul and Elizabeth suddenly departs.
Cam then sneaks back into the circus and overhears a conversation between Locke and his henchman, Sid. Cam is distracted by Elizabeth's singing and follows her voice to her tent. She warns him away, hinting at her bondage to Locke and the danger that Locke poses. Locke and Sid enter and warn Cam against interacting with Elizabeth.
Cam interacts with Elizabeth anyway, but is dragged off away from the scene. 
Later, at the dance, Elizabeth encounters Cam again. Their chemistry is undeniable, and Elizabeth reveals that Locke has her soul and is she unable to escape him. Her legs transform into a tail, and she leaves when Locke summons her. 
During this time, Locke has taken Elle to convince her to join him. She is imprisoned, but is found by Cam. They know they must retrieve Elizabeth's soul and help her leave. 
Locke discovers them during the plan. However, the magic from Elizabeth's soul is more powerful than his, so he is trapped. 
When they make it to the ocean, Elle is cured from the water. Cam and Elizabeth share a farewell kiss, and she swims away. 
Elle and Cam leave, content, and they all live happily ever after. The story ends with the grandmother coughing. The children follow her once she says, "time for a swim" and it is revealed that the grandmother is Elle, who is a mermaid herself along with Elizabeth.
