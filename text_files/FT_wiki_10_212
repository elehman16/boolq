WONDERS OF THE WORLD
Various lists of the Wonders of the World have been compiled from antiquity to the present day, to catalogue the world's most spectacular natural wonders and manmade structures.
The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the first known list of the most remarkable creations of classical antiquity; it was based on guidebooks popular among Hellenic sightseers and only includes works located around the Mediterranean rim and in Mesopotamia. The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty, and because it was the number of the five planets known anciently, plus the sun and moon.
Many similar lists have been made.
SEVEN WONDERS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD
Section::::Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
The historian Herodotus (484 – ca. 425 BC) and the scholar Callimachus of Cyrene (ca. 305–240 BC), at the Museum of Alexandria, made early lists of seven wonders. Their writings have not survived, except as references.
The classic seven wonders were:
* Colossus of Rhodes
* Great Pyramid of Giza
* Hanging Gardens of Babylon
* Lighthouse of Alexandria
* Mausoleum at Halicarnassus
* Statue of Zeus at Olympia
* Temple of Artemis at Ephesus
The only ancient world wonder that still exists is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
LISTS FROM OTHER ERAS
Section::::Lists from other eras.
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, some writers wrote their own lists with names such as Wonders of the Middle Ages, Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages, Seven Wonders of the Medieval Mind, and Architectural Wonders of the Middle Ages. However, it is unlikely that these lists originated in the Middle Ages, because the word "medieval" was not invented until the Enlightenment-era, and the concept of a Middle Age did not become popular until the 16th century. Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable refers to them as "later list[s]", suggesting the lists were created after the Middle Ages.
Many of the structures on these lists were built much earlier than the Medieval Ages but were well known.
Typically representative are:
* Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa
* Colosseum
* Great Wall of China
* Hagia Sophia
* Leaning Tower of Pisa
* Porcelain Tower of Nanjing
* Stonehenge
Other sites sometimes included on such lists:
* Cairo Citadel
* Cluny Abbey
* Ely Cathedral
* Taj Mahal

In 2001 an initiative was started by the Swiss corporation New7Wonders Foundation to choose the New7Wonders of the World from a selection of 200 existing monuments. Twenty-one finalists were announced January 1, 2006. Egyptians were not happy that the only surviving original wonder, the Great Pyramid of Giza, would have to compete with the likes of the Statue of Liberty, the Sydney Opera House, and other landmarks, calling the project absurd. In response, Giza was named an honorary Candidate. The results were announced on July 7, 2007, in Lisbon, Portugal:
