ARMY SERVICE UNIFORM
The Army Service Uniform (ASU) is a military uniform worn by United States Army personnel in situations where formal dress is called for. It can be worn at most public and official functions, and as an analog for business dress. In combat situations, the Army Combat Uniform is used.
The blue ASU replaced the "Army Green" and "Army White" service uniforms. Originally created in 2008 as a secondary uniform to the former army "class A greens", in the autumn of 2010 it started being issued to all soldiers and now is worn army-wide as the official service uniform. It is based on the older "dress blue" dress uniform. Older antecedents include the uniforms of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War and the Union Army's during the American Civil War. Their influence is apparent in the overall blue theme, the officers' passants (shoulder-straps) and trouser design.
On Veterans Day 2018, the Army announced that a new version of the Army Greens, based on the "pinks and greens" uniform worn in World War II, would be brought back as the everyday service uniform starting in 2020. The current Army Blues Uniform will return to being a formal dress uniform. The new service uniform will include khaki pants and brown leather oxfords for both men and women, with women having the option to wear a pencil skirt and pumps instead. There will be a leather bomber jacket as an outerwear option.
HISTORY
Section::::History.
The blue Army Service Uniform has been used since the late 2000s. According to Army Regulation 670-1: Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia, the Army Service Uniform seeks to combine dress and Service uniforms through wear stipulations. The ASU was announced in 2006 by then-Army Chief of Staff General Peter Schoomaker, and serves as the Army's dress, garrison, and ceremonial uniform. The blue ASU made its "debut" at the 2007 State of the Union Address, when General Schoomaker wore his blue uniform.
The ASU used the preexisting "army blue" uniform as a model. In terms of color the ASU resembles the campaign uniforms worn by soldiers during the Mexican–American War, American Civil War, Indian Wars, and the Spanish–American War prior to the introduction of khaki uniforms in the 1890s and olive drab uniforms in 1902, relegating the blue uniform to use as dress uniform. Dress uniforms of dark-blue tunics and light-blue trousers were worn by all ranks until 1917 and reintroduced in a modernized form (with open collar and tie) for officers and warrant officers in 1937.
Since 2010, enlisted soldiers have received the blue service uniform as part of their basic clothing bag issue when they enter the army during initial training. The Army further provides active-duty enlisted soldiers an annual clothing allowance to maintain their basic clothing bag issue items. The Army included a series of stipends in this annual clothing allowance to replace the green service uniform for already-serving soldiers. Commissioned officers are given a one-time stipend when commissioned to purchase their required uniform items. The Army requires officers to purchase and maintain only the blue service uniform. Possession and use of the blue ASU has been mandatory for all soldiers since October 1, 2015, when the green Class A was retired. 
Since the blue ASU is now standard, the only green service uniform remaining in the U.S. military are the Marine Corps's olive green service uniform.
DESCRIPTION
Section::::Description.
The ASU includes a midnight blue coat worn with lighter blue low waist trousers for male soldiers and a midnight blue coat worn with either lighter blue slacks or midnight blue skirt for female soldiers. The trousers/slacks for non-commissioned and commissioned officers
Include a stripe of gold braid on the outer side of the leg. Generals wear midnight blue trousers/slacks with gold braid instead of the lighter blue used in lower ranks. The fabric for the ASU consists of 55% wool and 45% polyester material. The ASU is worn with short- or long-sleeved white shirts with permanent military creases and shoulder loops. Compared to the Army's previous uniforms, the blue ASU does not include a garrison cap; soldiers continue to wear the Army's berets.
The dress blue ASU configuration for males includes the blue coat and trousers and a long-sleeved white shirt with black tie. The dress blue ASU for females includes the blue coat, skirt, and a long-sleeved white shirt with black neck tab. Females in army bands, honor guards, and female chaplains are authorized to wear army blue slacks in the performance of their duties. The black beret and service cap are authorized for wear with this uniform. Combat boots and organizational items, such as brassards, military police accessories and distinctive unit insignia are not worn. When the dress blue ASU is worn for social events in the evening (i.e. after retreat), men may wear a black bow tie rather than a black four-in-hand necktie, and commanders may direct that headwear is not required.
The class "A" ASU configuration includes the blue coat and trousers/slacks/skirt, a short or long sleeved white shirt and four-in-hand necktie (male)/neck tab (female). Ribbons instead of medals are worn to indicate awards. Soldiers in select units are allowed to wear black combat boots with bloused trouser legs instead of low-quarter shoes.
The class "B" ASU configuration includes the blue trousers/skirt/slacks, a short or long sleeve white shirt, omitting the coat of the class "A". Soldiers wear the black necktie with the long sleeve white shirt when it is worn.
