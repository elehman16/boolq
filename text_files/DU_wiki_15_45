ISRAELI PASSPORT
The Israeli passport (, Darkon Yisre'eli) is a travel document issued to Israeli citizens to enable them to travel outside Israel, and entitles the bearer to the protection of Israel's consular officials overseas. Israeli citizens have visa-free or visa on arrival access to 161 countries and territories.
Israeli citizens are allowed to hold passports of other countries, but are required to use the Israeli passport when entering and leaving Israel. This regulation was introduced officially in 2002, after having been legally contested on several occasions.
HISTORY
Section::::History.
Mandatory Palestine passports ceased to be valid at the end of the British Mandate of Palestine on 15 May 1948. Israel began issuing travel documents in 1948, after the Israeli Declaration of Independence on 14 May 1948. At first they were described merely as travel documents, with an initial validity of two years and used Hebrew and French texts. In 1952, the Knesset (Israeli parliament) passed the Israeli nationality law and Israel began issuing travel documents described as passports. The first passport was issued to Golda Meir, who at the time worked for the Jewish Agency and was soon to become Israel's ambassador to the USSR.
The first Israeli travel documents bore the limitation: "Valid to any country except Germany." An Israeli who wished to visit Germany had to ask that the words "except Germany" be deleted from their passport. This was done manually by drawing a line through these words. After the signing of the Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany in 1952, the limitation was withdrawn and passports became "valid to all countries".
Israeli passports issued after 30 March 1980 have used Hebrew and English texts, instead of the previous Hebrew and French. Subsequently, as new passports were issued, French texts were replaced by English texts.
In 2006, an Israeli passport became an accepted form of identification in elections in Israel. Previously, only an internal identity card was accepted for this purpose. 
Denial or withdrawal of an Israeli passport is one of the sanctions an Israeli rabbinical court may use to enforce divorce upon a husband who chains his wife into marriage against her will.
Since 2013, biometric passports have been introduced, in line with standards used by the United States, European Union and other countries. To obtain a biometric passport, an applicant must appear in an Interior Ministry office "to be photographed by the special camera which records information such as facial bone structure, distance between one's eyes, ears to eyes and ratio of facial features one from another. One will also be fingerprinted and all this information will be contained in the new high-tech electronic passport." It was reported that the border control representatives tore non-biometric passports of Israeli citizens.
DESCRIPTION
Section::::Description.
Israeli passports are navy blue, with the Israeli emblem in the center of the front cover, below the words "" and "STATE OF ISRAEL" in Hebrew and English, respectively. The words "" and "PASSPORT" are inscribed below the emblem. The inner pages are decorated with the Israeli emblem of olive branches and the seven-branched menorah. The regular passport contains 32 pages, and the business passport contains 64 pages.
Israeli passports are valid for up to 10 years for persons over the age of 18. They are bilingual, using both Hebrew and English. Since Hebrew is written from right to left, the passports are opened from their right end and their pages are arranged from right to left. Arabic is not used in Israeli passports, even though it is used in internal identity cards and is as having a 'special status in the state' with its use by state institutions to be set in law.

BACK COVER
Section::::Back cover.
The information on the inside back cover of an Israeli passport states in Hebrew only (English translation below):
This passport is the property of the State of Israel and is a valuable document which must be preserved carefully. Do not add or delete any information in the passport, tear out a page or pages from it, or destroy or corrupt the passport. The law states that the perpetrator of such action and who uses an illegal passport that is not his or lets anyone else use his passport illegally, has committed an offense and is liable to be punished.
An Israeli citizen who is also a foreign citizen and holds a foreign passport must enter and exit Israel with an Israeli passport or travel document.
In the case of loss or theft of the passport in Israel, the nearest Population Office must be immediately notified. If the passport is lost or stolen overseas, the nearest Israeli embassy or consulate must be notified.
Be careful not to lose your passport. When you use it, keep it secured inside the pocket of your clothes and not in your bag or car. When you travel abroad, it is recommended to bring a photocopy of the information page.
The passport is valid for all countries (unless otherwise noted) until the date listed on page 2. After expiration, or if your passport has worn thin or is filled, it must be replaced with a new one.
Attention!! This passport contains sensitive electronic circuits. For optimal functioning of these circuits, please do not fold, puncture and/or expose your passport to high temperatures and/or excessive moisture.
TRAVEL DOCUMENT
Section::::Travel document.
Israel may issue a travel document ( teudat ma'avar) to a person who does not have an Israeli or foreign passport which allows the person to enter and leave the country. It may be issued in the following circumstances:
* to a non-citizen residents / foreigners, who does not have another passport, for example a stateless person, or their citizenship not defined, to allow them to leave the country, for example in cases of foreigners who infiltrated to Israel and are deported, or foreigners who need to leave the country for any other reason and are unable to obtain a passport from another country.
* to Israeli citizens in lieu of a passport, for example for those, who lost their passports overseas.
Holders of a travel document are not entitled to the same visa-free entry to certain countries as holders of a standard Israeli passport, as the travel document is not accepted for travel or identification purposes by many countries. The use of a travel document to leave Israel does not, of itself, entitle the holder to enter another country nor to return to Israel.
TRAVEL DOCUMENT FOR FOREIGNERS
Section::::Travel document for foreigners.
A travel document ( "Teudat Ma'avar Israelit Lezarim") may be issued to Arab residents of East-Jerusalem who have neither Israeli nor Jordanian citizenship, and to non-Israeli Arab residents of the Golan Heights.
TRAVEL DOCUMENT IN LIEU OF PASSPORT
Section::::Travel document in lieu of passport.
A Travel Document in Lieu of National Passport ( Teudat Ma'avar bimkom Darkon Leumi) may be issued to an Israeli citizen by the Ministry of Interior in a number of circumstances:
* 90 days after immigration to the country, new citizens may apply for a travel document, and are required to use it to enter and exit the country starting 120 days after their immigration. After living 75% of their first year in the country, they are eligible to apply for an Israeli passport. However, after July 25, 2017 new immigrants no longer need to fulfill the residence requirement in order to acquire an Israeli passport.
* Foreign or stateless residents, and refugees.
* Israeli citizens with criminal record.
* Israeli citizens who have lost or destroyed over three passports.
* Israeli citizens who have lost their passport during an overseas trip.
* Israeli citizens who are returning to Israel by decision of the Israeli government.
They are normally valid for two years, and not for more than five years. The issuance of travel documents instead of passports became prevalent in the 1990s as the Israeli government reacted to a wave of Russian organized crime gangs who immigrated to Israel and began using Israeli passports for their activities.

Section::::Limitations on use by Israel.
Under the 1954 Israeli Prevention of Infiltration Law, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq and Yemen are designated "enemy states" and an Israeli citizen may not visit them without a special permit issued by the Israeli Interior Ministry. There has been a general suspension of this ban for Egypt and Jordan since the signing of the respective peace accords with these countries in 1978 and 1994 and removed from the list, however Iran was added to the list in 1979.
COUNTRIES THAT DO NOT ACCEPT ISRAELI PASSPORTS
Section::::Countries that do not accept Israeli passports.

In addition, eight of these countries — Iran, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — do not allow entry to people with evidence of travel to Israel, or whose passports have either a used or an unused Israeli visa. 
As a consequence, many countries may issue a second passport to citizens wishing to circumvent this restriction, and the Israeli immigration services have now mostly ceased stamping entry or exit stamps in all passports.
