RESPONSES TO SNEEZING
In English-speaking countries, the common verbal response to another person's sneeze is "bless you", or, less commonly in the United States and Canada, "Gesundheit", the German word for health (and the response to sneezing in German-speaking countries). There are several proposed bless-you origins for use in the context of sneezing.
In non-English-speaking cultures, words referencing good health or a long life are often used instead of "bless you," though some also use references to God.
In some Asian cultures such as Korean and Japanese cultures, the practice of responding to another person's sneeze does not exist.
