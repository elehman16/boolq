BURGUNDY (COLOR)
Burgundy is a dark red or purple or a dark red-ish purple tending towards brown. It takes its name from colour of Burgundy wine (from the Burgundy region of France, named after the ancient Germanic Burgundians). The French call this shade of red after a different wine region, Bordeaux; though in Quebec French, it is Bourgogne (). When referring to the color, "burgundy" is usually not capitalized.
The color burgundy is similar to other shades of dark red such as maroon, cordovan, and oxblood, but differs from each of these in subtle ways. For example, cordovan, with its origin in equine shoe-leather, has a slightly fairer, lighter brown color; whilst oxblood, typically describing leather clothing, has a much richer red and a little more blue. 
The first recorded use of "burgundy" as a color name in English was in 1881.
