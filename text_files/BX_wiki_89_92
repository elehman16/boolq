HISTORY
FORMATION AND EPONYMOUS ALBUM (2000–2002)
Section::::History.
Section::::Formation and eponymous album (2000–2002).
The band was formed in 2000 in Raleigh, North Carolina after the demise of the metalcore band Prayer for Cleansing, of which Rogers, Waggoner, and Goodyear were members. Nick Fletcher and Jason King subsequently joined on guitar and bass respectively. The name "Between the Buried and Me" was chosen after a section of lyrics in the Counting Crows song, "Ghost Train". Between the Buried and Me's first release was a three-song demo, containing the tracks "Use of a Weapon", "What We Have Become", and "More of Myself to Kill". These three tracks were re-recorded for the band's self-titled debut album, released through Lifeforce Records in 2002. The song "Aspirations" became the band's first music video. The album was not initially successful but did manage to catch the attention of Victory Records, to which they later signed. Victory reissued the album in 2004 as an enhanced CD.
The band toured in support of their first album with Canadian metalcore group The End.
