PREMISE
Section::::Premise.
The series follows Riley Parks (Jennifer Love Hewitt), who, after her husband abandons her and their children, leaving her in financial debt, accepts work at a day spa in her small Texas town, but refuses when she learns that for some clients the masseuses provide more than massages. But pressed to support her children, she relents and earns extra money through unspecified erotic services. As she deals with her children, her mother, her friends, the girls at the spa, and various men who want to romance her, Riley tries to keep her work in an erotic limbo a secret.

Although hesitant at first, she soon accepts this as a way to save their house and provide for her family. She has a supportive brother-in-law, Evan, who is always looking after her children when she is out and is a close friend to her.

PRODUCTION
DEVELOPMENT
Section::::Production.
Section::::Development.
The show is based around Lifetime's 2010 television film of the same name, with Jennifer Love Hewitt reprising the lead role. The series, however, is a re-imagining of the film and is not a direct continuation of the film's storyline. The most notable change is that the husband of Hewitt's character abandons his family in the television series before she becomes involved in prostitution, whereas in the film he leaves with their children after the scandal is exposed.
The pilot was written by Jordan Budde, and the film's producers all executive-produced the series alongside Hewitt. Budde got the job because Suzanne Martin was busy working on Hot in Cleveland at the time. Upon being given the assignment Budde watched the original movie and felt that the story had ended and also that it was "super depressing" instead he decided to reimagine the show and pitched it that way to Lifetime who accepted. At one point the network toyed with the idea of calling the show "The Rub" and have no connection to the original movie although they eventually decided against this.
Early on Hewitt was involved in the casting of her masseuse clients, although as the show went on she dialed back her involvement in this. This, in part, led to a complaints that "the guys were all so good looking". Later the team tried to cast "more real guys" although by this point the network refused, insisting on "hot guys".
Three promotional materials were filmed in October 2011 and released before the series premiered. The first of these materials, released on January 26, 2012, featured Hewitt performing Shirley Bassey's "Big Spender" in a music video-style advert, in reference to the true nature of the work at the massage parlor. The video received much interest from the media due to Hewitt's risqué role, who noted that "based on this new promo, the show is going to be seriously hot."

CONTROVERSY
Section::::Controversy.
The Client List was the subject of a nationwide campaign by licensed massage therapists to stop the show before it aired. The group, "Massage Therapists Against The Client List", asserts that:
The Client List is a series that perpetuates the misconception that Massage Therapy includes inappropriate sexual contact. Massage Therapists are trained healthcare professionals and in most states are licensed and regulated by state medical boards. They adhere to a code of ethics and in some cases are under higher ethical standards than other healthcare professionals – because of these very same misconceptions. Many therapists are now working in doctor's offices and hospitals and providing valuable therapeutic services. The Client List is a huge step backwards."
A&E responded to the controversy with the following press release:
We appreciate your feedback concerning the new Lifetime Television series entitled, The Client List. For many years, Lifetime television has explored the complexity of women's lives and their stories through fiction and non-fiction movies, series and programs. The Client List is a fictionalized story about the experiences of a single mother as she unexpectedly faces dire economic circumstances. The series also features a broad range of characters with alternative points of view who make different choices. The Client List is not intended to depict any specific spa or massage entity, nor in any way demean or disparage the therapeutic massage profession and its benefits and contributions to the health and wellness industry.
RENEWAL DELAY AND SHOW CANCELLATION
Section::::Renewal delay and show cancellation.
An expected third season renewal for the series was put on hold after the announcement of Jennifer Love Hewitt's pregnancy in June 2013. Hewitt reportedly wanted/insisted the real father of her child, co-star and fiancé Brian Hallisay, to also be the father of a fictional baby to be born by her character in the third season, while the show's executives and writers wanted Colin Egglesfield's character to be the father. Lifetime was undecided, which led to a renewal delay that lasted into October 2013. Due to creative differences between Hewitt, Lifetime, Sony Pictures Television, and ITV Studios America, the show was officially canceled on November 1, 2013 after two seasons.

Section::::Ratings.
The first season of The Client List, consisting of 10 episodes, was watched by an average of 2.51 million viewers per week. The second season, consisting of 15 episodes, was watched by an average of 2.05 million viewers.
