LIST OF NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION RETIRED JERSEY NUMBERS
As a way to honor key contributors including players, coaches, fans, broadcasters and announcers, National Basketball Association (NBA) teams often retire their jersey numbers, win totals or microphones. In the case of jersey numbers, they are usually no longer available for future players to wear, although they can ask for permission from players whose jerseys are retired. Teams usually display these numbers by hanging banners on the rafters inside their home arena. Currently, four teams (Los Angeles Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder, Orlando Magic and Toronto Raptors) do not have any retired numbers.

NOTES
* Loscutoff asked that his number (No. 18) not be retired to allow future Celtics to wear his number. His number is represented by "LOSCY." His number 18 was later retired in honor of Cowens.
* Jackson and Krause do not have actual numbers retired in their honor.
* Dawson does not have an actual number retired in his honor; rather, a banner with his initials is hanging from the rafters to pay tribute to his 27 years of service to the team.
* Numbers hang to the rafters as honored Minneapolis Lakers. These six Hall-of-Famers were instrumental to the franchise's success during its days in Minneapolis. Except for 22, which was retired for Baylor, and 34, which was retired for O'Neal, these "honored numbers" are still available.
* Although No. 33 is retired, Grant Hill received permission from Adams to wear it during his time with the Suns.
* As a result of the Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City in 2008, the SuperSonics' history (including retired numbers) is shared with the Oklahoma City Thunder, although the team colors, uniforms and logos remain available for use by a future NBA team in Seattle.
