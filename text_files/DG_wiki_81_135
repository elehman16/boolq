38TH ACADEMY AWARDS
The 38th Academy Awards, honoring the best in film for 1965, were held on April 18, 1966, at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica, California. They were hosted by Bob Hope.
The ceremony was broadcast on the ABC network and was the first to be broadcast live in color.
The two most nominated films were The Sound of Music and Doctor Zhivago, each with ten nominations and five wins. The winner of Best Picture was 20th Century Fox's and Robert Wise's The Sound of Music, adapted from the Rodgers and Hammerstein's Broadway musical. Both movies are in the top 10 inflation-adjusted commercially successful films ever made, and both would appear 33 years later on the American Film Institute list of the greatest American films of the twentieth century.
The Sound of Music was the first Best Picture winner without a screenwriting nomination since Hamlet; it would be the last until Titanic at the 70th Academy Awards. Othello became the third film (of four to date) to receive four acting nominations without one for Best Picture.
Lynda Bird Johnson, daughter of President Lyndon B. Johnson, attended the Academy Awards presentation and was escorted by actor George Hamilton.
