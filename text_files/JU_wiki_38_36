HISTORY
Section::::History.
After the Satyam scandal took place in 2009, the Standing Committee on Finance proposed the concept of the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) for the first time in its 21st report. Companies Act, 2013 then gave the regulatory framework for its composition and constitution. The Union Cabinet approved the proposal for its establishment on 1 March 2018. The establishment of NFRA as an independent regulator for the auditing profession will improve the transparency and reliability of financial statements and information presented by listed companies and large unlisted companies in India.
