LAURENCE
Laurence is an English and French given name. The English masculine name originates from a French form of the Latin Laurentius, a name meaning "man from Laurentum". It is possible, although unlikely, that the name of Laurentum is derived from the Latin laurus ("laurel"). 
The French feminine name is a form of the masculine Laurent, which is derived from the Latin name.
