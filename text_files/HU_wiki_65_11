COYOTE ATTACK
Coyote attacks on humans are uncommon and rarely cause serious injuries, mainly due to the relatively small size of the coyote, but have been increasingly frequent, especially in the state of California. In the 30 years leading up to March 2006, at least 160 attacks occurred in the United States, mostly in the Los Angeles County area. Data from the USDA's Wildlife Services, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and other sources show that while 41 attacks occurred during the period of 1988–1997, 48 attacks were verified from 1998 through 2003. The majority of these incidents occurred in Southern California near the suburban-wildland interface.
In the absence of the harassment of coyotes practiced by rural people, urban coyotes are losing their fear of humans, which is further worsened by people intentionally or unintentionally feeding coyotes. In such situations, some coyotes have begun to act aggressively toward humans, chasing joggers and bicyclists, confronting people walking their dogs, and stalking small children.
Although media reports of such attacks generally identify the animals in question as simply "coyotes", research into the genetics of the eastern coyote indicates those involved in attacks in northeast North America, including Pennsylvania, New York, New England, and Eastern Canada, may have actually been coywolves, hybrids of Canis latrans not fully coyotes.
FATAL ATTACKS
Section::::Fatal attacks.
Two fatal coyote attacks have been confirmed by experts:
* On August 26, 1981, an urban coyote grabbed a three-year-old girl named Kelly Keen in the driveway of her mother and father's home in Glendale, California and dragged her across the street. Her father rescued her by chasing the animal away and rushed her to Glendale Adventist Medical Center, but she died in surgery due to blood loss and a broken neck because of the incident.
* On October 27, 2009, two eastern coyotes mauled a nineteen-year-old singer-songwriter named Taylor Mitchell at Cape Breton Highlands National Park in Nova Scotia. She was on a break from her concert tour when they stalked and chased her down on the Skyline Trail. An air ambulance airlifted Taylor to Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, but she died after midnight from severe injuries and blood loss that were sustained during the assault.
NON-FATAL ATTACKS
ON CHILDREN
Section::::Non-fatal attacks.
Section::::On children.
While their bushy hair can make them look quite large, coyotes rarely weigh more than thirty-five pounds. Also, unlike some other canids, such as wolves and dogs, they are relatively less apt to hunt in packs large enough to take down a full-grown adult human being. Thus, coyote attacks tend to be a greater threat to children than they are to adults.
CALIFORNIA (1978–2003)
Section::::California (1978–2003).
A study published in 2004 documented 35 incidents in which a child escaped likely "serious or fatal injury" if the child had not been rescued in time. These included:

* On December 4, 2008, a nine-year-old boy in Erie, Colorado was snowboarding with his six-year-old brother on a golf course behind his house when a coyote attacked him. He used the snowboard to fend off the attack, but was bitten on the arm. A coyote in the area was then killed, but it wasn't clear if that was the same one that had bitten the boy, so he began a course of treatment for rabies.
* In June 2010, a 3-year-old girl and a 6-year-old girl were attacked and seriously injured in separate attacks by urban coyotes in Rye, New York. The six-year-old was attacked by two coyotes on June 25 and the three-year-old was attacked by one coyote on June 29. There was no indication the animals were rabid, but the girls were given treatment as a precaution.
* During a period of two months, from July to September, 2011, three children between the ages of two and six were bitten by a coyote, and a fourth was approached by a coyote within two feet in a neighborhood of Broomfield, Colorado. All four encounters are thought to have involved the same adult male coyote, who was lethally removed after the last attack.
* On August 24, 2011, before noon, a two-year-old Weymouth, Massachusetts girl was walking next to her stroller with her grandmother when a coyote lunged out of some hedges along the sidewalk in a suburban residential area. The animal attacked from behind, knocked the child down, and bit her on the back of her head, leaving a somewhat large wound. The grandmother was having trouble saving her from the coyote, when a neighbor came out of a nearby house and got the pair into the house, shutting the coyote outside, where it stayed, listening, while the homeowner dialed 911. The girl was taken to the hospital to have her scalp stitched. The authorities hunted the coyote but finding nothing, called off the hunt, but later that night police were called back to the area by calls that the coyote had returned. They shot the animal, and although it escaped, it was presumed to have been fatally wounded, but the body was not found, so the girl began a course of rabies treatments. One week earlier, a coyote in the same area tried to attack a landscaper, who successfully fended the animal off, sustaining no injury, so the area coyotes had not been hunted or trapped.
* On October 12, 2011, in Saginaw, Texas the Star-Telegram Deanna Boyd reported that a 3-year-old boy was about to get into the car Wednesday morning for his daily ride to day care and spilled his Cheerios. His mother dashed back inside the house to refill the bowl then heard a scream and ran back outside where she found the boy lying on the ground confronted by a coyote. The toddler, Colton, said he had seen it "coming too fast" and that it had "knocked me over." He suffered a scratch or welt on his right hand that did not break the skin. The coyote turned its attention to the mother and then the father who came out of the house and shot the coyote, which tested negative for rabies.
* On June 22, 2012, at Nehalem Bay State Park on the coast of Oregon, a coyote attacked a 5-year-old girl who was following her family back from the beach on a sand path through beachgrass. The coyote first grabbed a stick which the girl had been trailing behind her, then "lunged at" the screaming child, nipping at her ribcage and feet and breaking the skin on her back, before cutting off the attack to confront her father, who succeeded in driving the determined coyote off. The coyote was not caught, so the child began precautionary treatments for rabies.
* In the evening of March 12, 2013, two young boys in Boulder, Colorado were playing near a creek some distance away from their father, when they were surrounded by two coyotes. The boy who did not run was not bitten, but the five-year-old who ran toward his father was bitten on the leg before being saved by his father. Before this incident, the city had been having problematic encounters with coyotes for some time in the area, known as Boulder Creek Path, including attacks on adults, so they had instituted and just completed a four-week "hazing program" to instill fear of humans into the animals. After the incident, officials hunted down and killed two coyotes believed to be the same ones that had bitten the boy.
* On May 16, 2013, between six and seven PM, a two-year-old girl in Goose Gossage Park, Colorado Springs, Colorado, was playing on the slide with her mother and her brother. She came down the slide, her mother caught her, and set her aside, and just in the brief moment when her mom turned to catch her brother, a coyote bit the girl by the head and ran away. Doctors used stitches to close a large gash just over her right eye, and staples to close the gashes on the back of her head. The animal was not caught, so she began a course of rabies treatments. In the aftermath of this and the second attack, below, authorities conducted a large scale hunt for the animal, which resulted in the death of two adult animals. Also, the media printed criticism from area residents that the authorities had been slow to act to their complaints and warnings that the animals were dangerous. Authorities were quoted as saying that hunting or trapping would not help because other coyotes would take their place, and that the state "wasn't interested" in spending the money.
* On May 16, 2013, within an hour before the above attack and in the same place, a coyote had attacked a four-year-old girl, knocking her down and biting her on the backside, tearing her clothes. Authorities thought it was probably the same animal, and planned to kill it.
* On October 27, 2013, a three-year-old boy in Austin, Illinois within an alley was bitten by an animal badly enough to require plastic surgery. The authorities suspected a coyote, and trapped "a handful" in the area.

ON ADULTS
Section::::On adults.
Much of the published scholarly research on coyote attacks on adults comes from California, but press reports detail attacks all across the continent.
CALIFORNIA (1979–2003)
Section::::California (1979–2003).
Not all the coyote attacks on adults in California between 1979 and 2003 reported by Timm, et al. resulted in injury. In some, bitten articles of clothing or backpacks show that injury was narrowly avoided. In others, the attack was immediately broken off by the coyote once it could make off with an item the uninjured victim was carrying. While several victims were hiking, working, or jogging in unpopulated areas, many occurred at the victim's own home. Many appear to have been "test bites" on people who seemed incapacitated, but as soon as the victim reacted, the attack was abandoned. A selection of these attacks are listed below. Some add context to one or more of the attacks on children listed above. Many began as attacks on a person's pet, provoking sequential counter-attacks.

Coyote attacks on adults in other states:
* On May 22, 2008, 10:00 am, in an unpopulated area of Maine, a hunter was hunting with a friend, staying hidden and using a turkey call, when he was knocked down and bitten by a coyote. His thick hunting clothing prevented more serious injury, but suffered several small puncture wounds and tooth scratches, and one of his teeth was damaged when he was knocked down. The other hunter soon arrived, and the animal fled. After the attack, the victim was treated at the hospital for his wounds and started a course of precautionary rabies treatments.
* In June, 2008, in the Shadow Wood area of the Brooks community of Estero, Florida, a woman was walking her dachshund on a short leash when a coyote suddenly appeared, grabbed the dog, and tried to run away with it. She dropped to the ground, grabbed the severely injured dog, saving it from being carried off, but the coyote bit her on the right calf. She was taken by ambulance to a hospital where she was treated for four puncture wounds and began precautionary treatment for rabies, as the animal could not be found and killed for rabies testing right away. The incident was preceded by coyotes regularly feeding on dogs in the area, and followed by authorities hiring a professional trapper to cull area coyotes.
* In January, 2010, in Greenburgh, New York, a woman was taking a daytime walk through a wooded park when she was pounced on by a coyote. She screamed and, although she was aware that experts don't recommend it, she turned and ran as fast as she could and escaped, but not before she received puncture wounds and scrapes to her arms, legs, back, and buttocks. The coyote later attacked a pit bull terrier at its home adjacent to the same park, was spotted and chased by a police helicopter, and plans were being made for policemen with hunting backgrounds to try to track down the animal. The woman's wounds were treated and, although the coyote did not appear sick, she began a course of treatment for rabies.
