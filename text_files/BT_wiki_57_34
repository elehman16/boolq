It is governed by a local Council of Trustees and the Board of Governors of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. IUP has branch campuses at Punxsutawney, Northpointe, and Monroeville.

HISTORY
Section::::History.
IUP was conceived as Indiana Normal School, first chartered in 1871 by Indiana County investors. The school was created under the Normal School Act, which passed the Pennsylvania General Assembly on May 20, 1875. Normal schools established under the act were to be private corporations in no way dependent upon the state treasury. They were to be "state" normal schools only in the sense of being officially recognized by the commonwealth.
The school opened its doors in 1875 following the mold of the French École Normale. It enrolled just 225 students. All normal school events were held within a single building which also contained a laboratory school for model teaching. Control and ownership of the institution passed to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1920. In 1927, by authority of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, it became State Teachers College at Indiana, with the right to grant degrees. As its mission expanded, the name was changed again in 1959 to Indiana State College. In 1965, the institution achieved university status and became Indiana University of Pennsylvania, or IUP.
IUP total enrollment peaked in the Fall of 2012 at 15,379 and declined steadily since, reporting a total enrollment of 12,316 for the Fall of 2017. This decline in enrollment caused financial difficulties for the university which struggled to cover costs for its 2010 dormitory expansion.

CAMPUS
Section::::Campus.
IUP's main campus is a mix of 62 old and new red brick structures. Its original building, a Victorian structure named John Sutton Hall once housed the entire school. Today Sutton Hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It stands at the heart of campus—there was a fight to preserve it in 1974 when the administration scheduled it for demolition. Ironically, today it houses many administrative offices and reception areas. Breezedale Alumni Center is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Victorian mansion was once home to a Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice.
The campus boasts a planetarium, University Museum, black box theater, Hadley Union Building (HUB), extensive music library, and a newly remodeled Cogswell Hall for the university's music community. Stapleton Library boasts 900,000-plus bound volumes and over 2 million microform units. At the heart of campus is the Oak Grove. Many alumni recall this spot because of its centrality and the many events that occur there. In January 2000 former President Lawrence K. Pettit established a board to create the Allegheny Arboretum at IUP. This group works to furnish the Oak Grove with flora native to the region. The university also operates an Academy of Culinary Arts in Punxsutawney and a police academy at its main campus.
The university's Student Cooperative Association also owns College Lodge several miles from campus. It provides skiing, biking, hiking, and disc golfing opportunities. Boat access is also made available through the Cooperative Association.
Over the last five years, IUP has demolished most of the 1970 era dormitories on campus. Demolition began during summer 2006 and facilities are being replaced with modern suites. Construction is ongoing with seven new dormitories completed for Fall 2009. Two more suite-style buildings were completed by Fall 2010. That semester, the ribbon cutting ceremony at Stephenson Hall was considered to have finished the four-year-long "residence hall revival". These suite-style rooms are similar to those being built at other universities in PaSSHE.
