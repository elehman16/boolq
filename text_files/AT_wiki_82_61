HISTORY
MANAGEMENT
Section::::History.
Section::::Management.
Original Timberwolves owners Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner built, owned and operated the arena for five years beginning in 1990. The venue was managed by Ogden Entertainment after the city of Minneapolis purchased the arena in 1995. Glen Taylor acquired the Timberwolves in 1994 and the Lynx in 1999.
In 2000, SFX (later Clear Channel Entertainment) took over the contract. The management was changed in May 2004 from Clear Channel to Midwest Entertainment Group, a joint venture of the Timberwolves and Nederlander Concerts.
On May 2, 2007 AEG Facilities assumed the management contract of Target Center. The city of Minneapolis owns the arena and AEG Facilities manages day-to-day operations.
RENOVATIONS
Section::::Renovations.
In 2004, Target Center underwent a major renovation that saw the replacement of all 19,006 of its original seats plus the addition of nearly 1,500 new seats as well as the reconfiguration of the lower bowl to make the arena more "fan-friendly". In addition the arena's original scoreboard was replaced with a new 9-by-16 foot video screen and LED signage, LED signage on the upper deck fascia, a new lounge (Club Cambria) and improved access for fans with disabilities.
Target Center was once one of three NBA arenas with parquet floors, including TD Garden in Boston, and Amway Arena (later Amway Center) in Orlando—the floor was replaced prior to the 2008 NBA season.
Target Center is the first arena to have a green roof. It was unveiled on September 15, 2009. In February 2011, the Timberwolves and the city of Minneapolis introduced a $155 million proposal to remodel the Target Center. Plans included shifting the main entrance to the corner of 6th Street and First Avenue, two large glass atriums, another restaurant, and a complete remodel of the interior. The plan was approved in 2012 by the Minnesota Legislature, as part of the bill that authorized a new stadium for the Minnesota Vikings.
On April 3, 2015, the Minneapolis City Council gave the final approval for renovation plans for Target Center. The total cost was $140 million, which will upgrade the exterior, seats, technology and loading bays, among other areas. The city contributed $74 million. Glen Taylor, owner of the Timberwolves and Lynx, paid a total of $60 million; AEG contributed $5.9 million. As a result, the Timberwolves' lease will run until 2035. The renovated building reopened in October 2017.

ICE HOCKEY
Section::::Ice Hockey.
Target Center hosted 6 neutral site NHL games during the 1993–94 NHL season.

In June 2012, it was announced that the arena would play host to the future NCHC tournament games starting in 2014. The NCHC moved the tournament to the Xcel Energy Center in nearby St. Paul starting in 2018.
