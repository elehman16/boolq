SYNOPSIS
Section::::Synopsis.
The series follows the overnight shift at San Antonio Memorial Hospital, where three of the doctors have a connection to the U.S. military. Dr. TC Callahan is a former Army medic who initially exhibits PTSD-type symptoms, having watched his brother die right in front of him on the battlefield. He frequently breaks rules and butts heads with his ex-girlfriend and newly-appointed head of the night shift, Dr. Jordan Alexander, and the hospital's administrator, Michael Ragosa. Dr. Topher Zia is a former army medic, while Dr. Drew Alister is a gay Army medic still active in the reserves who initially tries to hide his sexual orientation for fear of backlash. Dr. Krista Bell-Hart is a young surgical resident trying to work her way up the ranks, while fellow resident Dr. Paul Cummings works hard to emerge from the shadow of his father, a famous surgeon at Johns Hopkins. The shift's lone psychiatrist, Dr. Landry de la Cruz, briefly works on the night shift.
Jordan is initially in a relationship with Dr. Scott Clemmens, which complicates things when Scott becomes the Chief of Surgery at the hospital and recurrently argues with TC. After a hostage situation that ends in Topher being shot, TC has a breakdown in the ER, and Scott breaks up with Jordan when he realizes she still has feelings for TC. After a cancer scare, Ragosa finds that he can no longer tolerate the stresses of his administrator job, and he quits that position in order to pursue his original dream of becoming a doctor. Meanwhile, TC's and Jordan's relationship quickly escalates, Topher makes his job as Head of Night Shift permanent, Krista, Kenny and a new surgeon become embroiled in a love triangle, and Drew spirals when his boyfriend ends their relationship. Some time later, TC and Topher head to Afghanistan to help an old friend of the latter, and Jordan suffers a stroke from pregnancy complications. In the season 2 finale, Ragosa passes his boards to become a doctor, TC and Jordan break up when she miscarries, Drew and his boyfriend make up, and get married, and Ragosa moves to Dallas to follow his ex-wife and kids. 
After some time away, Jordan hires Dr. Shannon Rivera as a replacement for Ragosa. She and Paul quickly strike up a rivalry turned romance. After an incident overseas, Drew and his husband adopt an foster daughter despite numerous setbacks. After a bomb that goes off outside the hospital, Topher discovers the hospital is being sold off to an Insurance Company with plans to turn it into a Plastic Surgery Center. TC returns to Syria to help with the Humanitarian Crisis. In the season 3 finale, Paul's father returns to the hospital to buy it. TC's camp gets hit by mortar fire when he attempts to leave, and Paul's father fires Topher due to his way of running the hospital, and most of the staff quits in protest. A few days later, TC reveals his intentions to remain in Syria, Jordan and Paul's father blackmail each other for the return of the hospital, and he makes Scott and Jordan the head of surgery and the ER, respectively. However, Jordan reveals that Topher and his daughter were killed in a car accident. Despite this, TC remains in Syria, while Drew discovers he must adjust his "act first" mentality due to his new role as a parent. In the Series finale, the hospital begins a medical-combat training program, causing Shannon, Paul and TC to question their role at the ER. Kenny gets engaged to Paul's sister, Drew goes to ranger school, with his husband's blessing, Shannon returns to her clinic on the reservation, Paul goes to Syria, and Scott and Jordan use the program to transform the hospital. In the end, TC tells Jordan he isn't ready to leave.
