LIST OF LAKES IN OKLAHOMA
The following is a list of lakes in Oklahoma located entirely (or partially, as in the case of Lake Texoma) in the state. Oklahoma has the largest number of lakes created by dams of any state in the United States, with more than 200. All lakes listed are man-made. Oklahoma's only natural lakes are oxbow and playa lakes. Oklahoma has sixty-two oxbow lakes at least 10 acres in size. The largest, near the Red River in McCurtain County is 272 acres.
Playa lakes are found in saucer-shaped depressions in the high plains region. They are usually intermittent, holding water only after rains. Oklahoma has about 600 playa lakes.
