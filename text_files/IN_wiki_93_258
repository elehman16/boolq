YELLOW RICE
Yellow rice is a traditional yellow-colored rice dish in Spanish, Cuban, Caribbean, Afghan, Indian, 
Sri Lankan and Indonesian cuisines (where it known as nasi kuning). 
Yellow rice is usually made by mixing white rice and onions while annatto, saffron or turmeric is used to give the yellow color. South African yellow rice, with its origins in Cape Malay cuisine, is traditionally made with raisins, sugar, and cinammon, making a very sweet rice dish served as an accompaniment to savoury dishes and curries.
Yellow rice is also consumed in Sri Lanka where it is known as kaha buth and draws from both Indonesian and Sri Lankan influences.
