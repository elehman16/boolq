PRODUCTION
OPENING SEQUENCE
Section::::Production.
Section::::Opening sequence.
For season four, the opening credits from season three were used with some minor revisions. The names (excluding Mitchel Musso as his character has become a recurring character) appear on a scrolling marquee as one would see on a theater, featuring a different font. The sequence then changes to wide-screen episode clips, in which only season 4 episode clips are included. The same version of the song "The Best of Both Worlds" from Season 3 was used; however, a green screened concert version was used with the Season 3 concert stage for the concert scenes. The creators' names appear in the second to last clip. A new version of the switch from Miley to Hannah is featured in the middle of the theme song, as Miley admires a hug between her and her dad in a clip of Hannah Montana Forever. At the end, the versions of Hannah's "shhh" and "laugh" clips were changed to one clip instead of two separate clips.
