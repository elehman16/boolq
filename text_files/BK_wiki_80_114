MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LAW
The Michigan State University College of Law (also known as Michigan State Law or MSU Law) is a private law school located in East Lansing, Michigan which is affiliated with Michigan State University. Established in 1891 as the Detroit College of Law, it was the first law school in the Detroit, Michigan area and the second in the state of Michigan. The current dean of the school is Lawrence Ponoroff. In October 2018, the College of Law gained approval to become fully integrated into Michigan State University, which will convert the school from a private to a public law school and is expected to take a year and a half to finalize.
The college is nationally ranked within the Best Law Schools in U.S. News and World Report, landing in the 88th spot in the 2019 rankings. The Michigan State Law Review is ranked 48 out of 317 by Washington & Lee University School of Law, which is the leading source for law journal rankings.
Notable alumni include Michigan Supreme Court Justice Elizabeth T. Clement, former Michigan Supreme Court Justice and mayor of Detroit Dennis Archer, former Michigan Supreme Court Justice and United States federal judge George Clifton Edwards Jr., politician and incoming Governor of Michigan Gretchen Whitmer, former Michigan gubernatorial candidate Geoffrey Fieger, former Michigan Senate majority leader and current U.S. Representative Mike Bishop, and current mayor of East Lansing Mark Meadows.
HISTORY
Section::::History.
Detroit College of Law opened in 1891 with 69 students and was incorporated in 1893. Among the first class of 69 students to graduate were a future circuit judge and an ambassador. It was the oldest continuously operating independent law school in the United States until it was assimilated by MSU in 1997.
In 1937, the college broke ground and relocated itself in a new building at 130 East Elizabeth Street in Detroit, where it stayed until 1997. The Building was designed by architect George DeWitt Mason. It had been located at the former Detroit College of Medicine building on St. Antoine Street from 1892 to 1913; and the Detroit "YMCA" building from 1913 to 1924; the ground on which the building stood was under a 99 year lease from the YMCA. The last location of the Detroit College of Law in Downtown Detroit is commemorated by a plaque at Comerica Park, the home stadium of the Detroit Tigers baseball team, which now occupies the site.
The college became affiliated with Michigan State University in 1995 to enhance that school's curriculum and reputation. It relocated to East Lansing in 1997, when its 99-year lease with the Detroit YMCA expired, and the original building was demolished to make way for Comerica Park. The newly located college was called "Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University". The affiliation was celebrated at a function where former President Gerald Ford joined more than 2,500 guests at the Wharton Center for Performing Arts Great Hall. Ford characterized the affiliation between Michigan State University and the Detroit College of Law "a bold new venture" that presents "a singular opportunity to help shape the changing face of American legal education well into the next century." In April 2004, the school changed its name to the MSU College of Law, becoming more closely aligned academically with MSU. Although it operates as a constituent college of the university, the college of law remains financially independent and receives no state or university funding.
Joan Howarth began her deanship at Michigan State University College of Law on July 1, 2008. Howarth is the 11th dean and first female dean in MSU Law's 117-year history. Beforehand, she was a professor at the William S. Boyd School of Law at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, since 2001. She retired at the end of the 2015-16 school year. Lawrence Ponoroff became the Dean in the fall of 2016.
On October 26, 2018, MSU's governing board, the Board of Trustees, voted to fully integrate the College of Law into the university, thereby converting it from a private to a public law school. Interim MSU President John Engler said this move could allow the law school to excel in new areas including autonomous vehicles, the food industry, and health law. He said the law college should leverage its close geographic connection with the Michigan State Capitol to further impact the state's legislative, executive, and judiciary branches of government. Dean Lawrence Ponoroff said, "Since the original affiliation in 1995, the relationship between the university and the law college has grown increasingly closer and, at each stage, resounded in benefits to both institutions." The integration is expected to take a year and a half to finalize.

The school also currently houses the Center for Legal Services Innovation (LegalRnD), which was introduced in 2015. Its director is the school's current Assistant Dean for Career Development and former Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn partner Daniel W. Linna Jr. The program allows the students to take innovative and technology oriented classes, such as Legal Analytics, Entrepreneurial Lawyering, and E-Discovery. The goal is that once the students go through the program, they will be better-equipped to find innovative ways to deliver legal services to clients and those in need.
LegalRnD likely replaced the school's former ReInvent Law program, which was founded by the school's former Daniel Martin Katz and current Renee Newman Knake. ReInvent Law likely ceased operations when Daniel Martin Katz obtained a new job at Chicago-Kent College of Law. A popular piece of legal technology that sprouted from the ReInvent law program is the StandIn phone app, which was partially founded by school graduate Andrew Johnston.
Currently, this program is a differentiating aspect when comparing Michigan State University College of Law to other law schools. In the short time that it has existed, it has partnered up with Michigan-based intellectual property law firm Brooks Kushman in order to find an innovative way to provide legal services to startups and entrepreneurs; and it has partnered up with Canada's MaRS. LegalRnD also helped to launch a ZeekBeek directory for law students with the objective being more exposure for the law students before graduation. The program has even garnered the attention of legal blogger Kevin O'Keefe.
