2018 OAKLAND RAIDERS SEASON
The 2018 season is the Oakland Raiders' 49th in the National Football League, their 59th overall, their 24th since their return to Oakland, and their first under head coach Jon Gruden since his rehiring by the organization (fifth overall). The Raiders will play their home games at Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum. This is their first season since 2013 without star defensive end/outside linebacker Khalil Mack, after he was traded to the Chicago Bears for Chicago's 2019 and 2020 first round draft picks.
With a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 13, the Raiders were the first AFC team to be officially eliminated from playoff contention and were eliminated from playoff contention for the second consecutive season. With their week 15 loss to the Bengals, the Raiders failed to improve their record from the previous season. The loss also secured their spot at last in the AFC West.
STADIUM ISSUES
Section::::Stadium issues.
Although the league approved the Raiders' eventual relocation to Las Vegas on March 27, 2017, the team still maintains its lease at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum and intends to use the stadium for at least the 2018 season, after which the lease is scheduled to expire. The Raiders' Las Vegas Stadium is not expected to be completed until 2020. In April 2017, the operators of the Coliseum stated they would be unwilling to sign an extension; by September of that year, the Coliseum operators expressed willingness to negotiate, but insisted on concessions to compensate for the million-dollar deficit the Coliseum runs by hosting Raiders games. The Raiders are believed to have substantial cash flow problems that could prevent them from making the necessary concessions. Owner Mark Davis has stated he would prefer to stay in Oakland for the 2019 season but is considering other options, including Las Vegas's Sam Boyd Stadium, Berkeley's California Memorial Stadium, Mackay Stadium in Reno, Nevada; the San Francisco 49ers's Levi's Stadium and even the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, a venue thought to have been ruled out in 2014. Davis acknowledged that if fans failed to support the team similarly to the 1996 Houston Oilers, it could hasten the relocation. Team management also indicated they would relocate after 2018 if there were any lawsuits filed against the team; the city of Oakland sued the Raiders and all other teams in the league on December 11, 2018, triggering a likely relocation after the 2018 season ends.
OFFSEASON
COACHING CHANGES
Section::::Offseason.
Section::::Coaching changes.
On January 6, 2018, the Raiders hired their former head coach, Jon Gruden, who returned to the Raiders and coaching from ESPN's Monday Night Football. Gruden received a 10-year, $100-million contract to return to the Raiders. Gruden last coached in the NFL in 2008 with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and last coached the Raiders in 2001. At the press conference announcing the hiring of Gruden on January 9, Gruden announced that Los Angeles Rams quarterbacks coach Greg Olson had been hired as offensive coordinator, though Gruden would call plays, while former Cincinnati Bengals defensive coordinator Paul Guenther was hired as the new defensive coordinator. Gruden also announced that former Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Dallas Cowboys special teams coordinator Rich Bisaccia was hired to serve as special teams coordinator. On January 29, the Raiders named Brian Callahan, son of their former head coach Bill Callahan, as the new quarterbacks coach.
