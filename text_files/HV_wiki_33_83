Section::::Features.
The controller functions as a secondary controller released for the console, available separately. The Wii U system can be connected to up to four Wii U Pro Controllers at one time, however Super Smash Bros. for Wii U allows the usage of more than 4. Like more traditional controllers, it features standard analog sticks and face buttons. Like the Wii U GamePad and Classic Controller Pro and unlike other eighth generation controllers (i.e., the DualShock 4 and the Xbox One Controller), the triggers are digital (i.e., not analog).
The Wii U Pro Controller uses the same 1300mAh CTR-003 battery found in the Nintendo 3DS and 2DS, which can last up to 80 hours before needing to be recharged.
Nintendo states that the design of the Pro Controller is an "enhanced version" of the Classic Controller and "offers a richer experience". Certain games with flexible control schemes, such as and , are also compatible with the Classic Controller. The Wii U Pro Controller is not compatible with previous-generation Wii games.
