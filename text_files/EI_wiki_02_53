EMBASSY OF TURKEY TO THE TURKISH REPUBLIC OF NORTHERN CYPRUS
The Embassy of Turkey to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus () is located in the Turkish Sector of Nicosia, just outside the walls of the Old City. It is unique in all of the foreign diplomatic missions located in Nicosia in that it is officially accredited to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), rather than the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus (what Turkey refers to as the Greek Cypriot Administration of South Cyprus as Turkey does not recognize the Greek Cypriot Republic as a legitimate entity).
The embassy was established in November 1983, shortly after the TRNC's Declaration of Independence. It is located just across the street from the TRNC Parliament Building.
