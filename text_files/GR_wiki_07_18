LIST OF GLACIERS IN GLACIER NATIONAL PARK (U.S.)
There are at least 35 named glaciers in Glacier National Park (U.S.). At the end of the Little Ice Age about 1850, the area containing the national park had 150 glaciers. There are 25 active glaciers remaining in the park today. Since the latest interglacial period began 10,000 years ago, there have been regular climate shifts causing periods of glacier growth or melt-back. The glaciers are currently being studied to see the effect of global warming It is estimated that if current warming trends continue, there will be no glaciers left in the park by 2030.
