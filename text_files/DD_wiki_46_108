A wide spectrum of students attend Pacific Coast High School, from those needing basic instruction to students that wish to get a jump start on their college education. Many students begin taking community college classes before graduation. Pacific Coast High School had a partnership with Coastline Community College's Distance Learning Department, but due to the budget crisis it is currently suspended. 
Other students choose PCHS because of their busy schedules. Some are highly involved in sports, dance, or music and this school gives them the freedom to work from anywhere through the Internet.
