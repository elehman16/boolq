HISTORY
Section::::History.
The first ever performance by Poland was at the 1994 contest: Edyta Górniak's song was also by far the most successful for Poland to date, receiving 166 points and placing second. Poland was almost disqualified that year though; there was no free-language rule in operation at the time, and a furor erupted at the dress rehearsal when Górniak sung the second half of "To nie ja!" in English. Six national delegations formally petitioned for Poland to be disqualified; however Eurovision rules required a majority of delegations (13 in this case) to complain before the European Broadcasting Union could examine the case for disqualification, so Poland was allowed to remain.
Subsequent Polish entries were less successful, placing between 11th and 20th.Poland returned to Eurovision following an enforced one-year absence 2002.
For the 2003 contest Poland organized its first public selection for Eurovision entry; It was no surprise when the group Ich Troje won the public vote ahead of Blue Café,placing 7th of 26 countries in the final.This placing allowed Poland to skip the semi-final of the 2004 contest, automatically qualifying for the final.
The polish entry for the 2004 contest was again selected through National Final,the winner of Krajowe Eliminacje was Blue Café with "Love Song".Group could not replicate Ich Troje's 7th place, receiving only 27 points and placing 17th.
In 2005 TVP went back to an internal selection, picking "Czarna dziewczyna", a multilingual song performed in Polish and Russian.Poland competed first time at the semi-final. The song just missed out on a place in the final, coming 11th in the semi-final with 81 points only 4 point behind Latvia.
Poland's 2006 entry with the comeback of the public vote on TVP, Ich Troje were chosen again in 2006 with song "Follow My Heart", but could not repeat their 7th place from 2003 failed to qualify for the final, coming 11th with 70 points in the semi-final only 5 point behind Macedonia.Poland's 2007 entry, "Time To Party", sung by The Jet Set, only finished 14th in the semi-final.
Poland's only appearance in the final between 2005 and 2011, was in 2008. Even then, its song ("For Life", sung by Isis Gee) placed a lowly 24th.
In the 2009,Poland selected Lidia Kopania and her song "I Don't Wanna Leave" performed in the second semi-final on 14 May 2009, however she failed to qualify finished 12th with 43 points.
The 2010 entry for Poland was Marcin Mroziński with song "Legenda",country performed in the first semi-final on 25 May 2010 but he didn't qualify for the final, finishing 13th with 44 points.
In 2011, Poland was represented by Magdalena Tul,and the country's entry was sung in Polish. Her song was called "Jestem", translated as "I'm",although initially a favorite with bookmakers, "Jestem" failed to qualify finished last 19th with 18 points in the first semi-final. This is the worst Polish result to date.
Members of the Polish OGAE have said at their annual convention that they would like Edyta Górniak to represent Poland for a second time. For years it was unknown if Górniak would enter Eurovision again, until when in 2016 she made a second attempt at representing her country in the contest, placing third in the national final.
