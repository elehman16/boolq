TAMPA SPARTANS FOOTBALL
The Tampa Spartans football program was an intercollegiate American football team for the University of Tampa (UT) located in Tampa, Florida that began play in 1933. The program competed against other small college programs in the forerunner of today's NCAA Division II for almost forty years before moving to the top level of NCAA Division I as an independent in 1971. Successfully competing against top college programs as a much smaller school put an enormous strain on the university's finances, and the school decided to discontinue football after the 1974 season.

BEGINNINGS OF THE PROGRAM
NICKNAME AND COLORS

Section::::Beginnings of the program.
Section::::Nickname and colors.
When the University of Tampa was founded as Tampa Junior College in 1931, St. Petersburg Junior College was expected to be their top athletic rival. Since the neighboring sports teams were known as the Trojans, the University of Tampa's sports teams became the Spartans, a selection inspired by the Trojan War between Troy and Sparta in ancient Greece. Though the mascots were chosen to promote the rivalry, it never developed, and St. Petersburgh College later changed its athletic nickname to the Titans. Meanwhile, Tampa Junior College moved to its current location in the former Tampa Bay Hotel in 1933, changed its name to the University of Tampa, and organized a football program.
Most of the University of Tampa's early students were from Tampa, and most of its early athletes were graduates of Hillsborough High School and Plant High School. Hillsborough's colors are black and red and Plant's colors are gold and black, so Nash Higgins, Tampa U's first football coach, decided that the Spartans would combine the colors and wear red, gold, and black.
SMALL COLLEGE FOOTBALL
Section::::Small college football.
The University of Tampa Spartans began play with a 28-0 win over Bowdon College in LaGrange, Georgia on October 12, 1933. They played their first home game a week later at Plant Field, which was their home field for their first three seasons. The Spartans shared Plant Field with many other community events, so the school built Phillips Field on nearby land donated by local businessman I. W. Phillips and moved to their new stadium in 1937.
During their first three and a half decades of football, the Spartans predominantly competed against other small colleges, mostly in the south. They usually fielded competitive teams and won two Cigar Bowls, a small college bowl game played in Tampa. The Spartans occasionally competed against larger programs, including the University of Florida Gators, whom they never defeated in five contests. The Spartans also scheduled eleven games against the Florida State Seminoles in the 1940s and 1950s, soon after FSU began its football program. Tampa U went 2-9 in those games, and they last met in 1959.
MOVE TO DIVISION I
Section::::Move to Division I.
In 1963, head coach Fred Pancoast encouraged the university to move its football program to the top tier of college football, NCAA Division I. The Spartans moved from Phillips Field to brand new Tampa Stadium in 1967 and became an independent Division I program beginning with the 1971 season. The Spartans continued to have success, highlighted by wins over established programs Ole Miss and Miami and a 10-2 1972 campaign that was capped by a win in the Tangerine Bowl. The Spartans were led by star players Leon McQuay, Freddie Solomon, Noah Jackson, and John Matuszak, who was the first overall pick in the 1973 NFL Draft.
ENDING THE PROGRAM
Section::::Ending the program.
Although the Spartans found success on the field against Division I opponents, the University of Tampa had only about 1,300 students during the early 1970s, and the football program was putting an increasing financial strain on the small school's limited resources. In early 1975, university president B.D. Owens and the UT finance committee proposed dropping football, citing rising expenses. Owens revealed that the football program had run a deficit of almost $200,000 in 1974 ($ today) and that UT had borrowed over $750,000 ($ today) from its endowment to subsidize football since its move to Division I, pushing the entire university towards possible bankruptcy. He also expressed concern that Tampa's new NFL franchise would erode attendance at Spartans' games, increasing financial losses even more. (The Tampa Bay Buccaneers were organized in 1974 and took the field in 1976.) To the disappointment of Spartan players and coaches and the Tampa community in general, the UT Board of Trustees voted on February 20, 1975 to immediately end the football program, cancelling the already scheduled 1975 season.
The Spartans played their last game on November 11, 1974, a 35-10 win over Florida A&M, though no one knew at the time that it would be their final contest. The football program finished with an all-time record of 201-160-12.
STADIUMS
Section::::Stadiums.
Plant Field was the first stadium the team used. Named after Henry B. Plant, the stadium hosted the first ever Major League Baseball game in the Tampa Bay area. At the stadium, is a plaque to commemorate 4,300 fans who attended the game and saw Babe Ruth hit the longest home run. The University of Tampa football team used Plant Field from 1933–1936. Phillips Field opened on October 4, 1937 and was the home to University of Tampa football for thirty years. The stadium had wooden seating, in a horseshoe and was on the banks of the Hillsborough River. Tampa Stadium was built in 1967 and the team would play here until they closed down the football program. The first game that the University of Tampa played in this stadium was a 38-0 loss against the third ranked team in the country, the Tennesee Volunteers.
