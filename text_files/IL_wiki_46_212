HURACÁN LP 640-4 PERFORMANTE (2017-PRESENT)
Section::::Huracán LP 640-4 Performante (2017-present).
A track oriented variant of the Huracán, called the Performante, was unveiled at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show.
The Performante underwent various exterior changes with the most noticeable being the front and rear bumpers. Carbon fibre is used for the bumpers and the side skirts. An adjustable carbon fibre rear wing has been added to increase downforce. The position of the exhaust has also been changed, and is now just a bit above the rear diffuser. The interior also underwent noticeable changes, now sporting new seats and a new digital speedometer (similar to that of the Aventador SV's speedometer).
The Performante's 5.2-liter V10 has been tuned to produce at 8,000 rpm and of torque at 6,500 rpm. The weight has also decreased by , courtesy of the forged aluminium and forged carbon fibre body components (first used in the construction of the Sesto Elemento). All the new aero components on the car have active aerodynamic capability and help keep the car stable at high speeds. The Performante is capable of accelerating from in 2.9 seconds and in 6 seconds and has a theoretical top speed of .
The car has been stiffened by 10% with new springs, roll bars, and radial axial arm bushings. The magnetorheological suspension has been reworked to give a driver a serious track experience. The Lamborghini Dynamic Steering has been re-calibrated. The Performante utilises Lamborghini's new ALA (Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva) system, which is said to be 80% lighter than regular sports car hydraulic systems. According to Lamborghini, ALA is also said to provide 750% more downforce than the standard Huracán. The price of the car is set at US$274,390.
In October 2016, a prototype of the Performante set a lap time of 6:52.01 on the Nürburgring Nordschleife, with Marco Mapelli behind the wheel, making it one of the world's fastest production cars around the track. This lap was also made on Marco Mapelli's first attempt. However, some critics have stated complaints around the car's lap time, from the official video being sped up to make the lap believable, to the speeds displayed in the video being false or that it did not use road tires. However, Lamborghini was able to prove that the lap the Performante did was fully legitimate exactly a week after the lap around the Nordschleife when they revealed the data to car website, Road & Track. Máté Petrany of R&T had met with lead engineer of Lamborghini, Maurizio Reggiani, to ask about the lap. It was then revealed by Reggiani that the Performante's active aerodynamic system called Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva is what gives the car the greatest improvement in lap time. What is more important is the spoilers snapping into their lowest-drag setting when the Performante is aimed forward, which results in the removal of acceleration impediment that big aero causes. The Huracan Performante's lap time was beaten by the Porsche 911 GT2 RS which set a lap time of 6:47.3 in September 2017.
As the Lamborghini Huracán LP640-4 Performante is lighter than the Lamborghini Huracán LP610-4 by 40 kg, it gives the car a power to weight ratio of per horsepower.
HURACÁN LP 640-4 PERFORMANTE SPYDER (2018–PRESENT)
Section::::Huracán LP 640-4 Performante Spyder (2018–present).
The Lamborghini Huracán Performante Spyder was unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show. It takes much of the styling inspiration from the coupé and the outgoing LP 610-4 Spyder. The spyder is identical to the coupé from performance and technological standpoint, but the acceleration time from has risen by one-tenth of a second and stands at 3.1 seconds while the has risen by four-tenths of a second and stands at 9.3 seconds. Due to the loss of the roof, the Spyder weighs more than the coupé due to chassis reinforcing components. Top speed remains the same as well and stands at . Deliveries of the Spyder began in Q4 of 2018.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION
Section::::Technical information.
 ! Models
The Huracán has electronically controlled all-wheel drive, which aims to increase the traction on various surfaces and the overall performance of the car. The car has a 7-speed dual clutch transmission, Lamborghini's new 'Doppia Frizione' (Dual Clutch) gearbox. The transmission performs differently depending on the mode the driver has selected. The Huracán will only be available with an automatic transmission; a manual will not be offered.
The Huracán also has a magnetically controlled suspension system. It utilises magnetorheological dampers to very quickly change how the suspension acts, ensuring performance as well as usability.
The Huracan has various components in common with the next generation Audi R8. This is due to both of the cars' utilization of Volkswagen Group sportscar technology.
INTERIOR
Section::::Interior.
The Huracán features various interior options for more comfort inside the car. It features a choice for full electric control and heating of the sport seats in addition to the standard lengthwise alignment and electric backrest. The car also has an optional navigation system and leather upholstering. The Huracán is one of the first sports cars moving infotainment out of the center stack: Lamborghini Infotainment System. The result: a display that lets the driver decide what they want to see. It is the first vehicle to use the 12.3 inch TFT virtual cockpit from parent company Audi, which is available with high-definition (1440 x 540) 3D computer graphics, Bluetooth, Google Earth GPS navigation and Multi Media Interface-like menu and dashboard controls, all powered by Nvidia Tegra 3.
TECHNOLOGY
Section::::Technology.
Various aspects of the Huracán are technologically advanced. The car has full LED headlamps, which ensures higher contrast in night conditions. Also, the Huracán has optional "Lamborghini Dynamic Steering" (LDS) to add to the standard power steering. The Dynamic Steering changes the steering performance from normal, comfortable steering to a racing feeling. The main control for changing the car's performance according to driving conditions is the mode selector ANIMA (Adaptive Network Intelligent Management). ANIMA controls the engine, the transmission, LDS, the all-wheel drive, magnetorheological suspension, and the electronic stability control. The Lamborghini Piattaforma Inerziale (LPI) carries out precise measurements of the vehicle movements using on board sensors (3 accelerometers and 3 gyroscopes) linked to ANIMA via high-speed FlexRay CAN bus. The driver can select street, sport, or race mode to alter how systems like the engine or transmission respond while driving. Depending on what mode is selected, even engine sound is different.
PRODUCTION
Section::::Production.
The Huracán's chassis is assembled by Lamborghini's parent company Audi in Neckarsulm, Germany. It is transported to the Lamborghini headquarters in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy, where the final assembly occurs.
Within the first month of the Huracán LP 610-4 preview period, 700 orders of the vehicle were obtained. Before the official launch, Lamborghini registered more than 1,000 orders of the Huracán LP 610-4.
