This replica was built in 1993, the same year as another one in the United States, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Tennessee. Original plans made the construction five feet taller than the one in Tennessee and a cowboy hat added to the top, in a competitive spirit, made the total height 65 feet.
CONSTRUCTION AND DETAILS

It was built by members of the local welders' union and is less than one tenth the height of the 1,063-foot original. A shiny red cowboy hat was added to the top of the spindle in 1998. The tower has 27 thirty-watt LED lights which are programmed by color according to season (red and green at Christmas), and used by announcements by expectant couples revealing the sex of their babies, pink (for girls) or blue (for boys).
