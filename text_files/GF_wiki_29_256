PROFESSIONAL CAREER
SEATTLE SEAHAWKS (FIRST STINT)
Section::::Professional career.
Section::::Seattle Seahawks (first stint).
Bennett was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Seattle Seahawks on April 27, 2009. An NFL Draft analyst noted that Bennett was not drafted probably due to his inconsistent performance in college. The team initially believed he could serve at left defensive end. After working with coaches during training camp, he was moved to the inside as a pass-rushing tackle. During the preseason, he compiled nine tackles, two sacks, five QB hurries, a tipped pass and a fumble recovery. He made the final roster by the end of the preseason.
Bennett was waived by the Seahawks on October 10, 2009 in order to make room for offensive tackle Kyle Williams, who was signed off of the practice squad.
TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS
Section::::Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Bennett was claimed off waivers by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on October 12, 2009. Tampa Bay switched him back to defensive tackle, and he became a key part of the defense filling in for the injured Gerald McCoy.
Bennett's best season as a Buccaneer came in 2012 when he recorded career-highs in tackles (41), sacks (9), and forced fumbles (3).
SEATTLE SEAHAWKS (SECOND STINT)
Section::::Seattle Seahawks (second stint).
Bennett was signed as an unrestricted free agent by the Seattle Seahawks on March 14, 2013. He signed a 1-year contract reportedly worth $4.8 million, with $1.5 million guaranteed. On March 24, 2013, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that Bennett had a torn rotator cuff. On December 2, 2013, Bennett scored his first NFL touchdown against the New Orleans Saints after recovering a fumble from the Saints quarterback Drew Brees. Bennett was in fact a key contributor to the 2013 Seahawks defensive unit that ranked first in the NFL and went on to win Super Bowl XLVIII.
On March 10, 2014, the day before free agency began for the 2014 season, the Seahawks re-signed Bennett to a four-year, $28.5 million contract with $16 million guaranteed. Rumors had previously stated that Michael could be joining his brother Martellus in Chicago.
After the Seattle Seahawks defeated the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship game on January 18, 2015, Bennett commandeered a Seattle police officer's bicycle and took a victory lap around Century Link Field.
In Super Bowl XLIX, with 18 seconds left in the end of the game, Bennett committed a neutral zone infraction. Afterward, a brawl ensued, but Bennett was unaffected. The Seahawks lost to the Patriots 24–28.
On October 22 of the 2015 season, in a game against the San Francisco 49ers, Michael Bennett recorded 3.5 sacks of Colin Kaepernick. The Seahawks won the game 20-3, and Bennett was named defensive player of the week for his performance.
Eight games into the 2015 season, Bennett was ranked as the ninth-best edge defender in the NFL by Pro Football Focus. Through those eight games he had 31 total tackles (21 solo), 6.5 sacks, 1 forced fumble, and 8 tackles for loss. He was ranked 59th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.
On December 30, 2016, Bennett signed a three-year $31.5 million contract extension with the Seahawks, with one year still on his previous contract, now keeping Bennett signed through the 2020 season. He was named to his second straight Pro Bowl in 2016, and was ranked 46th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.
On December 10, 2017, in a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Bennett struck the knees of Jaguars center Brandon Linder on a kneel down. This led to an altercation between the two teams, and that resulted in teammates Sheldon Richardson and Quinton Jefferson being ejected from the contest.
On January 22, 2018, Bennett earned his third straight invite to the Pro Bowl after Minnesota Vikings defensive end Everson Griffen could not attend due to injury.
PHILADELPHIA EAGLES
Section::::Philadelphia Eagles.
On March 7, 2018, the Seahawks agreed to a trade that will send Bennett and a seventh round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for wide receiver Marcus Johnson and a fifth round draft pick. The deal became official on March 14, 2018, at the start of the new NFL league year.
On October 7th, 2018, Bennett was penalized during a game against the Minnesota Vikings for violating the new rule about roughing the passer.

PERSONAL LIFE

Bennett has two sisters: Ashley Bennett and Renekia Leathers; and three brothers: Donte, Martellus, and Reshaud Bennett. His younger brother Martellus, who is a tight end, was drafted in the second round of the 2008 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys.
Bennett's sack dance, in which he places his hands on his head and swivels his hips, is modeled after professional wrestler Rick Rude.
Bennett has recently decided to sit during the singing of "The Star-Spangled Banner" before football games. He said his stance was influenced by the violence at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
LEGAL ISSUES
Section::::Legal issues.
In August 2017, Bennett was involved in an incident outside a Las Vegas nightclub with two police officers. Bennett claimed that the officers used excessive force on him and stated the police "threatened to blow my head off." The police have denied his accusations, and claim the video evidence does not corroborate Bennett's story. Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said he found no evidence that three officers who encountered Bennett racially profiled him or used excessive force against him. The incident remains under investigation.
On March 23, 2018, a warrant was issued for Bennett's arrest by police in Harris County, Texas for allegedly injuring an elderly paraplegic worker at Super Bowl LI, held 13 months previously.
