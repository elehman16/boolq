SOUTH AFRICA AT THE RUGBY WORLD CUP
South Africa have played at six of the eight Rugby World Cup tournaments, having been unable to compete in the first two tournaments due to a sports boycott during the apartheid era. Following the end of apartheid, they hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup and won the tournament, and were champions again at the 2007 tournament in France. With two tournament wins, they are one of the three best performing teams, along with Australia who have also won twice, and New Zealand with three wins, the only team to do better.
