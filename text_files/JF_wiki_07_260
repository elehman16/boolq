PLOT
Section::::Plot.
Will and Samantha (Sam) are a young couple who are expecting their first child. Will flies from Seattle to visit Sam's parents in Chicago, intending to ask permission to marry Sam from Tom, her disapproving father. At dinner, Will and Tom get in an argument and Will does not mention the proposal.
The next day, Sam calls Will before his flight back. There is a mysterious sound and Samantha, scared, says, "Something's wrong" before the call disconnects and Will cannot call her back. At the airport, all flights are cancelled. During a TV news report that discusses preliminary reports on a seismic event off the West Coast of the United States that has disrupted electrical power and telecommunication, electricity and phone lines in Chicago are disrupted. Will returns to Sam's parents' house, where Tom and Will agree to travel together to Seattle to find Sam.
Amid heavy traffic, Will and Tom discover that soldiers have closed off the interstate highway for safety reasons. Tom manages to persuade them to let his car through. That night, they are pulled over by what appears to be a police patrol but is in actuality an escaped convict with a shotgun. The ensuing firefight results in an accident that fractures Tom's ribs. Tom knocks out the convict with a blunt object and they use the police cruiser to tow their damaged car to a nearby reservation. 
At the reservation, Tom finds a mechanic, Ricki, who fixes the car and agrees to travel with them in case their car breaks down again. The trio set out, making sure to restock for provisions when they can, first at a small town reluctant to help outsiders and again at an abandoned theme park. At one point, robbers hold the three of them at gunpoint and steal their gasoline reserves. While Will drives after the robbers, Ricki shoots out the tires, causing the robbers' car to flip over. With the flipped car's leaking gas tank and surrounding fire, they barely have enough time to take their gasoline back before the car explodes, resulting in the robbers' deaths. Upset over the consequences of her actions, Ricki leaves Tom and Will.
The next day Tom's lungs collapse. Will performs a needle thoracostomy to help him breathe. Sensing that Tom will die without medical help, the two of them bond and Will finally feels that Tom approves of his relationship with Sam. On a bridge, they encounter a gang of armed men on motorcycles. The two of them work together to evade the gang, but Tom succumbs to his wounds and dies. The car breaks down and Will continues the journey on foot.
A family picks Will up and he leads them to his father's house in Idaho where they all rest. Will strikes a deal with the family to take their four wheel drive in exchange for them staying at his father's well-stocked house until they are ready to go north, where they hear the situation is better. As he gets closer to Seattle, Will sees that the city is almost completely destroyed. He sees a note left by Sam with an address to a cabin. 
At the cabin, Will finds Sam with their neighbour Jeremiah. The next morning, Jeremiah attempts to kill Will, having fallen in love with Sam. Will shoots him as he turns to fire his pistol. Soon after, an earthquake triggers a large eruption, causing a pyroclastic flow. Will and Sam drive away from the all-engulfing cloud.
