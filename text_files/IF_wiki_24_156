PLOT
Section::::Plot.
On the morning of the 2014 NFL Draft, Cleveland Browns general manager Sonny Weaver Jr. must decide how to use the seventh overall pick to improve the team, but he has other problems on his mind. His semi-secret girlfriend Ali Parker, the team's salary cap analyst, is pregnant, and she wants the two of them "not to be a secret any more." Also, the recent death of Sonny's father, the Browns' former head coach, and his refusal to participate in his mother's draft-day-interrupting memorial plans cause tension with her. 
The Seattle Seahawks hold the first overall draft pick, and general manager Tom Michaels offers to trade it to the Browns at a very high price, which then would allow the Browns to draft highly-rated quarterback prospect Bo Callahan, whom everyone expects to be the first-drafted player. Sonny at first declines, but under orders from team owner Anthony Molina to "make a splash," he reluctantly makes the deal, trading away the Browns' first-round draft picks for the next three years. The unexpected opportunity to obtain Callahan excites Browns fans, but splits the team's front office and players.
The trade goes public after a tweet by disappointed Ohio State linebacker Vontae Mack, who had been Sonny's original preference. Now Seahawks fans are unhappy at missing out on Callahan, putting great pressure on Tom Michaels. Vontae advises Sonny to re-watch college footage of him and Callahan playing against each other, with Mack coming out on top. Sonny begins to have doubts about Callahan's ability under pressure, and the Browns' investigations also bring Callahan's character into question. When the draft begins that evening, Sonny agonizes until the last minute, deciding whom to take with the first overall pick. Eventually, he chooses Vontae Mack instead of the expected choice, Callahan. Roger Goodell's announcement of the selection shocks the rest of the league and disrupts many of their plans for their own picks. Molina is irate that Sonny passed over Callahan and flies back to Cleveland, intent on firing Sonny. Head coach Vince Penn is also incensed with the Browns' loss of first-round draft picks for the next three years for Mack, whom they could have had for one pick all along, and Penn threatens to resign.
Rumors spread about Callahan as other teams also avoid selecting him, wondering what the Browns know that caused Sonny not to pick him. However, the Seahawks are still in contention to pick Callahan with the seventh pick they got in the trade with the Browns, and Sonny senses an opportunity. He convinces the rookie general manager of the Jacksonville Jaguars, who don't need a new quarterback, to trade him their pick at sixth in exchange for the Browns' second-round draft picks for the next three years. Sonny then calls Michaels, who fully intends to take Bo Callahan at seventh pick. Sonny informs him that the Browns now have sixth pick and intend to take Callahan. In return for passing on Callahan to let the Seahawks have him, Sonny demands his first-round picks back, along with punt returner David Putney. Feeling great fan pressure, the Seahawks seal the deal and choose Callahan at sixth pick. With his now-restored seventh pick, Sonny appeases Penn and Molina by selecting skilled running back Ray Jennings of Florida State, who passionately wants to play for the Browns because his father had been a star with them.
Molina and his team celebrate an outstanding draft for the Browns, which sportscaster Chris Berman extolls as getting three fine players — Mack, Jennings and Putney — "for one pick!" (Apparently, Berman forgot about the three years of second-round picks Sonny gave up in the trading.) After the draft party, Sonny reconciles with his mother over his excellent draft performance and her soon-to-be first grandchild.

PRODUCTION
Section::::Production.
When the idea was first made public, the film was to be centered around the Buffalo Bills, but the studio subsequently changed it to the Cleveland Browns because of cheaper production costs in Ohio.
Crowd reactions of fans at the actual 2013 NFL Draft, as well as Cleveland Browns fans at local bars, were filmed. Cameos with real-life NFL figures such as league commissioner Roger Goodell and ESPN sportscaster Chris Berman were filmed before and after the draft took place. The rest of the film began filming on May 8, 2013.
2014 NFL DRAFT
Section::::2014 NFL Draft.
As in the film, the Cleveland Browns made splashes at the draft, trading up to select quarterback Johnny Manziel with the 22nd pick. The team also made several deals, trading away their fourth pick to the Buffalo Bills but for their ninth pick, as well as their 2015 first round pick. They later traded up to the eighth pick to draft Justin Gilbert. Finally, after watching Manziel drop farther than projected, they again traded up for the 22nd pick. Chris Berman, who played himself in the fictionalized draft, commented at the 2014 NFL Draft that the events surrounding the Cleveland Browns were more exciting than the film. Unlike the film, the Browns selected the much-hyped Heisman Trophy winning quarterback, as opposed to passing on Bo Callahan, the fictionalized first pick favorite.

CRITICAL RESPONSE
Section::::Critical response.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 59% based on 153 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "It's perfectly pleasant for sports buffs and Costner fans, but overall, Draft Day lives down to its title by relying too heavily on the sort of by-the-numbers storytelling that only a statistician could love." On the aggregated review site Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.
Chicago Sun-Times critic Richard Roeper gave the film a "B", stating the film is "a sentimental, predictable, sometimes implausible but thoroughly entertaining, old-fashioned piece."
On the contrary, Jack Hamilton of Slate was harshly critical. "The 'filmmaking' here consists of making sure the camera is pointed at people who are explaining the film's plot to one another, preferably while they are wearing logos and standing in front of more logos," he wrote. He suggested the NFL's involvement had made the film too upbeat. "[It] isn't so much a movie as a movielike infomercial for the kinder, gentler NFL ... In the wake of labor strife, off-field scandals, and the ongoing CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) crisis, the NFL is doubling down on its fantasy of paternalism, and Draft Day is that fantasy's porn film."
Former Green Bay Packers vice president Andrew Brandt criticized Draft Day as "lacking any true depiction of how an NFL team operates leading up to and during the draft", and less realistic about the business of sports than Jerry Maguire and Moneyball.
