FASTEST ANIMALS
This is a list of the fastest animals in the world, grouped by types of animal.
FASTEST ORGANISM
Section::::Fastest organism.
The fastest land animal is the cheetah, which has a recorded speed of . The peregrine falcon is the fastest bird and the fastest member of the animal kingdom with a diving speed of . The fastest animal in the sea is the black marlin, which has a recorded speed of .
While comparing between various classes of animals, a different unit is used, body length per second for organisms. The fastest organism on earth, relative to body length, is the South Californian mite Paratarsotomus macropalpis, which has a speed of 322 body lengths per second. The equivalent speed for a human running as fast as this mite would be . This is far in excess of the previous record holder, the Australian tiger beetle, Cicindela eburneola, the fastest insect in the world relative to body size, which has been recorded at or 171 body lengths per second. The cheetah, the fastest land mammal, scores at only 16 body lengths per second while Anna's hummingbird has the highest known length-specific velocity attained by any vertebrate

1
Peregrine falcon
Flight-diving
The peregrine falcon is the fastest aerial animal, fastest animal in flight, fastest bird, and the overall fastest member of the animal kingdom. The peregrine achieves its highest velocity not in horizontal level flight, but during its characteristic hunting stoop. While stooping, the peregrine falcon soars to a great height, then dives steeply at speeds of over .

Golden eagle
Flight-diving

White-throated needletail swift
Flight
4
Eurasian hobby
Flight
Can sometimes outfly the swift
5
Mexican free-tailed bat
Flight
It has been claimed to have the fastest horizontal speed (as opposed to stoop diving speed) of any animal.
6
Frigatebird
Flight
The frigatebird's high speed is helped by its having the largest wing-area-to-body-weight ratio of any bird.
7
Rock dove (pigeon)
Flight
Pigeons have been clocked flying average speed on a race.

Spur-winged goose

Yellowfin tuna   Many tuna species are capable of swimming at fast speeds colloquially cited at around . The tails of tuna move fast enough to cause cavitation, which slows them down as vapour accumulates. Tuna have bony fins without nerve endings, which prevents the fish from feeling the pain of cavitation but does not fully protect them from the implosive damage.
Shortfin mako shark   Underwater and unimpeded by a fishing line, the Shortfin Mako has been reliably clocked at 31 miles (50 kilometres) per hour, and there is a claim that one individual of this species achieved a burst speed of 46 miles (74 kilometres) per hour. But it is extremely difficult to get a fish in the wild to swim in a straight line over a measured course. Laboratory measurements of numerous kinds of fishes — representing a wide range of body sizes — swimming against an artificial current have revealed a surprisingly uniform maximum burst speed of about 10 times the body length per second. Thus, for an average-sized, 6.5-foot (2-metre) Shortfin, its theoretical maximum speed might be something on the order of 45 miles (72 kilometres) per hour. Yet some estimates of the top-speed of a Shortfin Mako are considerably higher.

The wildebeest, an antelope, exists as two species: the blue wildebeest and the black wildebeest. Both are extremely fast runners, which allows them to flee from predators. They are better at endurance running than at sprinting.
Lion
The lion (Panthera leo) It is the second fastest wild cat with a top running speed of 80.5 km/h though it lasts only for very short bursts and can be highly exhausting, hence they have to be close to their prey before starting the attack.
African wild dog
They live in jungles, and have been recorded going anywhere from to , although only in short bursts.
Hyena  
Avg max over fastest 10 to 20m was 45 kmh/28 mph Compared to other land animals, humans are exceptionally capable of endurance, but exceptionally incapable of great speed.
* Hicham El Guerrouj set the current men's mile run (5,280 feet/1,609.344 metres) world record of 3:43.13.
* Svetlana Masterkova set the current women's mile run (5,280 feet/1,609.344 metres) world record of 4:12.56.
In the absence of significant external factors, non-athletic humans tend to walk at about and run at about . Although humans are capable of walking at speeds from nearly 0 m/s to upwards of and running 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) in 6.5 minutes, humans typically choose to use only a small range within these speeds.

Members of Loliginidae and Ommastrephidae
Many of these species "fly" out of the water to escape danger. The Japanese flying squid can glide for 3 seconds over 30 metres.
