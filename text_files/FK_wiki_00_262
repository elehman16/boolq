PLOT
Section::::Plot.
Lily Owens lives on a peach orchard, in South Carolina in 1964. Her father T-Ray is widowed, abusive, and often angry with her. On her 14th birthday, the harvest is starting, societal and personal unrest consumes her life, and a string of events, a mix of mystical, terrifying, and unjust, pushes her to run away to find a better life. 
With Lily goes Rosaleen, their housekeeper. Lily is blonde and naively confident; Rosaleen is African American, in her 20's, politically aware, and proud. Rosaleen was beaten hours earlier in front of Lily, and somehow Lily gets her out of the hospital and both on the road. Lily has but a few hoarded mementos of her mother, dead almost 10 years. One is a label: "Black Madonna Honey", Tiburon, S.C., and Tiburon becomes their destination.
In two days they reach Tiburon and find their way to the home of August Boatwright and her sisters May and June. August has used her skills as a beekeeper to build a successful business. She has also built a strong community of black women who gather regularly in prayer, overseen by a life-sized statue of a black woman whose arm reaches out in blessing.
Despite the unlikeliness of Lily's lies about their circumstances, August takes them in, in trade for labor. Lily becomes an apprentice beekeeper. She discovers May's "wailing wall", tucked full of little notes about events that have distressed the brittle sensitive May, and she learns about the "Black Mary" in the living room. 
In time Lily confides her truths in Zach, the teenage son of one member of the prayer group and August's assistant beekeeper. They try to watch a movie together, but her disregard for racial barriers, sitting with Zack in the "colored" section, gets Zack kidnapped and roughed up, and Lily yelled at. To protect May, June and August hide the news, but Zack's mother cannot, and the event breaks May. Though Zack is returned the next day, it is too late for May who in pain has drowned herself. 
With May's funeral comes some reconciliations and truths. June, strong and proud, agrees to wed her long-time boyfriend. Rosaleen is asked to be part of the household family. Lily, who already believes she probably killed her mother, as we see in flashbacks, now blames herself for Zack's kidnapping and May's death. She smashes several jars of honey and packs her things to run away, unloved and unloveable.
Before she runs, August challenges Lily's outlook, and tells her about Lily's mother, whom August cared for as a child and later sheltered from T-Ray. Simultaneously T-Ray has sleuthed out her location. Lily does not want to leave, especially with him, and the three women form a phalanx of support. T-Ray admits that her mother would probably had taken her had she not been killed, and with angry reluctance leaves her to be raised on the Boatwright farm.
The movie closes with an older Lily narrating as she tucks a journal of the story into May's wall.
