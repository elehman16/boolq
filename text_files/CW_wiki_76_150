Written by vocalist and guitarist Benjamin Burnley and then-drummer Jeremy Hummel, the song is described as featuring "hard rock roots, ... a vocal-centric aesthetic, heavy electric rhythm guitars", and "an aggressive male vocalist".
TRACK LISTING
CONTROVERSY
Section::::Controversy.
When drummer Jeremy Hummel filed a federal wrongful termination lawsuit against the band, he contended that he co-wrote the song. In March 2010, it was announced that Hollywood Records was seeking the band's permission to produce the remix with additional vocals from Sydnee Duran of Valora. In May 2011, while the band was on hiatus due to Burnley's health issues, guitarist Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski gave the label permission to remix the song after being offered money. Burnley fired both two days later. In June, Burnley filed a lawsuit against Fink and Klepaski, seeking at least seven hundred and fifty thousand in damages and the exclusive right to the band's name. He claimed that both members had made unilateral and unauthorized decisions on behalf of the band, though both of them denied these claims. On April 19, 2013, Burnley announced that the dispute between him and the other members had been resolved and that he retained the right to continue the band under the name Breaking Benjamin.
