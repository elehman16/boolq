BEE AND PUPPYCAT
Bee and PuppyCat is an American animated web series created and written by Natasha Allegri, and directed by Larry Leichliter. The series revolves around Bee (voiced by Allyn Rachel), an unemployed woman in her twenties, who encounters a mysterious creature named PuppyCat (voiced by the Vocaloid program Oliver). She adopts this apparent cat-dog hybrid, and together they go on a series of temporary jobs to pay her monthly rent. The show is produced by Frederator Studios and is animated by Dong Woo Animation and OLM, Inc.. The series later expanded to include a comic book series by the same name, published by KaBoom! Studios.
Critical reception for the series has been positive, while some fans have criticized the art and tone changes between the pilot and the kickstarted backed full series. In December 2014, critic Robert Lloyd of The L.A. Times listed it as one of the best TV shows of the year. The A.V. Club favorably rated the episode "Food Farmer", which they felt did a good job expanding Bee's character.
It will be followed by a new series titled Bee and PuppyCat: Lazy in Space in 2019.
PLOT
Section::::Plot.
Bee is a cheerful young woman in her twenties who is habitually fired from menial, low-paying jobs. On her way home from a failed job opportunity, PuppyCat, a strange, mysterious creature, falls from the sky. She takes him in and, when he sees that she is broke and unemployed, PuppyCat teleports himself and Bee to an alternate dimension where they are given a job by TempBot, a gigantic, intelligent television screen. Despite the dangers that this line of temporary jobs would pose, Bee finds that she has a talent for the work and that it pays well enough for her to disregard the dangers. An ongoing plot element of the series is PuppyCat's past, which is shrouded in mystery. There are hints that he may be a space outlaw who was transformed by the Space King, who was angry over the pirate's romance with his daughter. However, due to his anger, the magic meant to capture him instead turned him into a monster and he escaped. Another ongoing plot element is Bee's romantic feelings for her friend Deckard, a talented chef who seems to harbor a crush on Bee but finds that this complicates his decision to pursue a cooking career.
CHARACTERS
* Bee : Bee is a young woman who, while walking home in the rain after being fired, is hit on the head by PuppyCat, who mysteriously appears out of the sky and lands on her. After being transported to Fishbowl Space with PuppyCat, she gains clothing reassignment from TempBot, who changes every mission and gives her various equipment like a sword or pockets full of glitter. Bee is also seen to have a strong dislike of water, as in the episode "Beach" where she refuses to walk into the ocean, and in the following episode, "Cats", where she refuses to take a bath when she gets dirty.
* PuppyCat : The mysterious creature that is both a dog and a cat, and is the companion to the main character, Bee. Not much is known about PuppyCat except that he can "talk" and be used as an energy cannon. (As demonstrated in the battle with Wallace.)
* TempBot: Also referred to as AssignBot, is a robot that acts as a temporary employment agent for PuppyCat. This character is voiced by a different actor in each episode. In the pilot episode the character was voiced by Marina Sirtis, Hannah Hart for "Farmer", Roz Ryan for "Cats", Ellen McLain in "Birthday Game" and Joan Koplan in "Wedding".
* Deckard : A good friend of Bee and neighbor, he works as a prep cook and harbors romantic feelings for her. He has heterochromia (differently-colored eyes).
* Cass : Cass is Deckard's sister, who works as a programmer. While she likes Bee, Cass is afraid that Bee is holding Deckard back—something she knows that Bee would hate if it were true.
* Cardamon : Cardamon is a young boy who is Bee's landlord. He is business-like and mature for his age, in stark contrast to his appearance as an elementary schoolboy. He takes care of his comatose mother, whom he regards as a "princess."
* Toast : Toast is the 11th ranked wrestler from Cass' former wrestling team and holds a grudge against Cass' departure, as it leaves her to be the lowest-ranking member on the team.
PRODUCTION
Section::::Production.
The series began as a two-part episode, which was uploaded to Frederator Studio's YouTube channel Cartoon Hangover as two 5-minute shorts as part of Too Cool! Cartoons, as well as a 10-minute video combining the two parts. Part one went online on July 11, 2013, while part two and the full film went online on August 6, 2013.
After gaining popularity online, Cartoon Hangover started its first Kickstarter project in order to fund additional episodes. The Kickstarter started on October 15, 2013, and achieved its 600,000 goal with 6 days left; by the end, it had raised $872,133, funding ten 6-minute episodes, the first of which would air in the summer of 2014. As of its funding date, Bee and PuppyCat became the most successful animation Kickstarter in history, the #4 film/video Kickstarter (behind only three Hollywood-based projects), and the #1 Kickstarter based on a YouTube video.
In May 2014 KaBoom! Studios launched a Bee and PuppyCat comic book.
Bee and PuppyCat: The Series premiered November 6, 2014 with a second two-part episode.
Outside of a Kickstarter-exclusive early showing of episodes 5 and 6 in August via VHX, no new episodes were released in 2015.
Production for season 1 was wrapped up in March 2016. The remaining completed episodes of Bee and PuppyCat were planned to be released on YouTube in late Spring/early Summer 2016 but were released November 11, 2016 on VRV instead.
In March 2017, Frederator announced that new episodes of Bee and PuppyCat were being written. In June 2018, the trailer for the continuation was released under the title Bee and PuppyCat: Lazy in Space, which will be aired sometime in 2019.
