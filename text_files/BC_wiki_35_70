JORDANIAN DINAR
The Jordanian dinar (; code: JOD; unofficially abbreviated as JD) has been the currency of Jordan since 1950.
The Jordanian dinar is also widely used alongside the Israeli shekel in the West Bank. The dinar is divided into 10 dirham, 100 qirsh (also called piastres) or 1000 fulus.
HISTORY
Section::::History.
From 1927 to 1950, the Palestine Currency Board issued the Palestine pound as the official currency in both Mandatory Palestine and the Emirate of Transjordan. After Jordan became an independent kingdom on 25 May 1946, the idea of issuing a national currency arose and led to the passing of the Provisional Act No. 35 of 1949. Under this Act, the Jordan Currency Board was formed, which became the sole authority entitled to issue Jordanian currency in the kingdom. The London-based entity consisted of a president and four members.
As of 1 July 1950, the Jordanian dinar became the kingdom's official currency, and use of the Palestine pound ceased in the kingdom on 30 September 1950. Although issued by the Jordan Currency Board, the notes bear the country's official name, "The Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan".
Until 1992, coins were denominated in Arabic using fils, qirsh, dirham and dinar but in English only in fils and dinar. Since 1992, the fils and dirham are no longer used in the Arabic and the English denominations are given in dinar and either qirsh or piastres.

Since October 23, 1995, the dinar has been officially pegged to the IMF's special drawing rights (SDRs). In practice, it is fixed at 1 U.S. dollar = 0.709 dinar most of the time, which translates to approximately 1 dinar = 1.41044 dollars. The Central Bank buys U.S. dollars at 0.708 dinar, and sell U.S. dollars at 0.710 dinar.
