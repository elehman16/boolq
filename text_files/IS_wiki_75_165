OVERVIEW
Section::::Overview.
The series is set in the late 9th century AD, when England is divided into seven separate kingdoms. The Anglo-Saxon lands are gradually attacked, plundered, and effectively ruled by Viking Danes in many areas. The Kingdom of Wessex remains the last major stronghold against the Danes.
The protagonist is Uhtred of Bebbanburg. Several men of that name existed and ruled Bebbanburg (Bamburgh Castle), but little is known of their actual lives. In short historic sections at the end of each book, Bernard Cornwell explains that he is descended from them and decided to invent a history based on actual historic events.
The tale has its main character be re-baptised as Uhtred after his elder brother is killed by the invading Danes. Then his father along with other Saxon noblemen of Northumbria are killed in battle with these same Danes. Only his uncle and step-mother survive. Uhtred and a Saxon girl named Brida are taken as slaves by Earl Ragnar, now settled in Danish Northumbria which becomes their adopted home as they grow older. Time passes and Ragnar's daughter Thyra is about to be married, but fellow Danes attack the night before the wedding and set the hall ablaze in which the whole family are sleeping. Ragnar is burned alive, and Thyra is taken as a slave. Only Uhtred and Brida escape, as they had been in the woods watching the charcoal burn.
The attackers are led by Kjartan, a disgruntled Viking who had been banished by Ragnar from his lands years earlier for an offense committed by Kjartan's son Sven. Uhtred vows to avenge his adoptive father's death, while simultaneously hoping to reclaim Bebbanburg from his uncle—who seeks to kill Uhtred in order to hold onto the land of Bebbanburg.
Uhtred is forced to choose between a kingdom that shares his ancestry and the people of his upbringing, and his loyalties are constantly tested.
The first series' story line roughly covers the plots of the novels The Last Kingdom and The Pale Horseman, although they are condensed for the purposes of television. The second series covers the plots of Cornwell's novels The Lords of the North and Sword Song. Season 3 is based on The Burning Land and Death of Kings.

CRITICAL RECEPTION
Section::::Critical reception.
The series has been met with a positive critical response. On Rotten Tomatoes season 1 has a 92% rating based on reviews from 26 critics, with an average rating of 7.61/10. On Metacritic season 1 has a score of 78/100 based on 15 reviews.
Sam Wollaston reviewed the first episode in The Guardian and warned, "It's wise not to get too attached to anyone in The Last Kingdom." Charlotte Runcie gave the opening episode 4 stars out of 5 in The Daily Telegraph. Wollaston and Runcie both remarked on the similarities between Last Kingdom and Game of Thrones.
Sean O'Grady in The Independent found that some of the language gave the series "a satisfyingly earthy quality," but he thought that the plot was "a little convoluted". The television reviewer for Private Eye was more critical, arguing that The Last Kingdom demonstrates how Game of Thrones "haunts the BBC," and that the series was directly derivative of both fantasy series and European dramas such as The Killing and Wallander, yet lacking the features that have made such series successful.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Section::::Historical Background.
The main events of the reign of Alfred the Great and his heirs are well recorded, and a number of men called Uhtred ruled from Bamburgh Castle, most notably Uhtred the Bold more than a century later. The people identified as "Danes" came from many places of Denmark, including Southern Sweden and Norway which were Danish during the Viking era. Historians believe that the Danish invaders of Northumbria came from Jutland in Denmark, as mentioned in Cornwell's books, as well as some of the Danish islands and East Denmark (southern Sweden).
Ubba from Season One really existed. He is thought to have led a mixed force including Frisians and men from Ireland. The TV series Vikings has him born in Norway and the son of Ragnar Lodbrok. There are records that support this, but some historians doubt it.
In each of his books, Bernard Cornwell has a section giving details of what is recorded historically, and what he has invented.
