RELEASE
Section::::Release.
The first pre-order release was on October 26, 2017 with the soundtrack released in full on December 8, 2017 by Atlantic Records.
It debuted at number 71 on Billboard 200, and later stayed at number one for two weeks. On January 7, 2018, the soundtrack had been on the top of the Billboard 200 for two weeks, reaching its top in its fourth week of availability. It had sold 106,000 copies. In the third week it became number two. The Greatest Showman beat that week's top album in traditional album sales (70,000 vs. 65,000) and was the top-selling album of the week, but did not top the Billboard 200 due to TEA units and SEA units. By February 7, 2018, the soundtrack was a breakout hit at number 1 on the UK album charts and number 2 in the United States. On February 8, 2018, Stereogum published an article writing that "statistically speaking, The Greatest Showman is by far the most popular album of the year so far."
By February 27, it was the top album on iTunes. By March 23, 2018, it had been the number one in the UK for eleven straight weeks, more than "any other album in modern chart history except Adele's 21." It had sold 465,000 copies, with around 40% of those sales on CD and vinyl. By April 6 the album climbed back up the charts for its 12th non-consecutive week at number one.
CRITICAL RECEPTION
Section::::Critical reception.
The album was selected for the 2017 Oprah's Favorite Things list. By February 23, 2018, the track "This Is Me" was nominated for Best Original Song at the 2018 Academy Awards. According to Sky News on March 25, 2018, "music critics have put the album's success down to the feel-good, uplifting pop tunes which are also old school at the same time."
Sheila O'Malley of RogerEbert.com called the 11 songs "memorable," praising the vocal performances of the leads. The women's magazine Bustle gave it a positive review, particularly certain vocal performances. Stereogum described the soundtrack music as eclectic in its influences, giving it a negative reception for "[serving] up earnest buoyancy in many high-fructose flavors." Also noting the eclectic mix of musical genres, The Ringer writes that "the bombastic tunes mix EDM gleams with stadium-rock grunts, chest-pounding ballads with peppy empowerment anthems, a thoroughly modern and disconcertingly eager post-genre assault designed to barnstorm as many Spotify playlists as possible. It's a gilded cheese ball, pushing exhilaration to the point of exhaustion." The Guardian wrote that the album brought "a whole lot of self-empowerment, enlivened with some deracinated R&B beats, and given the necessary gravitas by some power ballads of the sort that make one imagine the singer filmed from below with a wind machine blowing in their face."
