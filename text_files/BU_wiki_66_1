LEBANON NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM
The Lebanese national football team, controlled by the Lebanon Football Association (LFA), has officially represented Lebanon in association football since their inception in 1933. The squad is under the global jurisdiction of FIFA and is governed in Asia by the AFC. Other than the successful qualification for the 2019 edition of the Asian Cup, Lebanon have never qualified for a major competition through the regular qualification process (although they have hosted the 2000 Asian Cup). Lebanon mainly plays their home games at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium in Beirut, but can also be seen playing at the Saida International Stadium in Sidon as well as in various other stadiums throughout the country.
While their first FIFA recognized game was played in 1940, Lebanon have disputed various unofficial matches prior, with the first one being against Romanian side Altak in 1934. During the 2014 qualification campaign for the World Cup, Lebanon managed to reach the final stage for the first time in its history thanks to a famous 2–1 win over South Korea at home in 2011; however, the Lebanese team would fail to qualify for the World Cup coming last in its group in the fourth round. Lebanon also competes in various minor tournaments, namely the WAFF Championship, the Arab Nations Cup, at which they achieved a third-place finish in the first edition, hosted by Lebanon itself, and the Pan Arab Games, where they managed two third-place finishes in both times the competitions were hosted in Lebanon.
Taking inspiration from their national symbol, the Lebanese team is known as The Cedars (منتخب الأرز) by fans and media alike; they mainly wear red for their home kit and white for their away in reference to the colours of their national flag, with the green being used for the goalkeeper's kit. Following a steady decrease in the FIFA ranking from 1998 to 2016, in the last two years Lebanon jumped 66 positions, from 147th in 2016 to 81st in 2018, during which Lebanon achieved their best ever ranking at 77th in September 2018. This came after a 15-game unbeaten streak, spanning from 24 March 2016 to 11 October 2018, in which Lebanon won 8 games and drew 7.
HISTORY
1933–1979: EARLY HISTORY
Section::::History.
Section::::1933–1979: Early history.
On 22 March 1933, Lebanese journalist Nassif Majdalani founded Lebanon's first and current sports federation: the Lebanese Football Association; it would join FIFA in 1935 and the AFC in 1964.
In 1934, the Lebanese national team played its first game against Romanian side Altak at the Municipal Stadium in Beirut after the team from Romania had played against the American University of Beirut football team; the match ended in a goalless draw. Lebanon, represented by Beirut XI, would play its first game with Syria (Damascus XI) in 1939 at the Habib Abou Chahla Stadium with the match ending in a 4–5 loss. Beirut XI would go on to play a total of 17 unofficial games against Damascus XI til 1963, with Lebanon winning 9, drawing 2 and losing 6. The national team's first official FIFA game was played on 27 April 1940 against Palestine; Lebanon was defeated 5–1 with Ibrahim Mualem scoring their maiden goal. In 1944, Lebanon lost against an unofficial Iraq national team, representing the Ministry of Education, that was coached by Englishman George Raynor.
During the 1950s, Lebanon was coached by Vinzenz Dittrich before and Ljubiša Broćić after: the side played four official games but only managed one draw against Syria in 1953. The national team also played various unofficial games against different top-level European clubs, such as Dynamo Moscow and Leipzig, as well as Energia Flacara Ploiesti and Spartak Trnava.
Between 19 and 27 October 1957, Lebanon hosted the second edition of the Pan Arab Games; they were drawn with Saudi Arabia, Syria and Jordan in the group stages. After two 1-1 draws against Saudi Arabia and Syria, Lebanon won 6-0 against Jordan thanks to two braces by Joseph Abu Murad and Mardek Chabarian, as well as a goal each by Robert Shehada and Levon Altonian coming first in their group. In the semifinals Lebanon would lose 4-2 against Tunisia; they would however finish in third place as Morocco withdrew from the Third Place match.
In 1958 Joseph Nalbandian was appointed as coach of the national team: he became one of Lebanon's most successful coaches winning 8 official matches in 22 games during his 11 year spell. Under Nalbadian, Lebanon hosted the Arab Cup in 1963: they would play with Tunisia, Syria, Kuwait and Jordan. Lebanon won their first match against Kuwait 6–0 thanks to a hat-trick by captain Levon Altonian: this would be Lebanon's biggest win at that point, tied with a 7–1 win over Saudi Arabia in 1961. After another win, against Jordan, and two losses, against Syria and Tunisia, Lebanon finished in third-place in the tournament. 
Lebanon's first Asian Cup qualifying campaign came in 1971; they would be coached by Joseph Abou Murad. In the first round, they lost to the host Kuwait 0–1, but later defeated their traditional rival Syria 3–2 qualifying to the next round. In a decisive semi-final match against Iraq, Lebanon lost 1–4, failing to qualify for its first AFC Asian Cup.
Despite the Lebanese Civil War, Lebanon appeared in the 1980 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, held in Abu Dhabi; however, by losing against Syria, Lebanon was out of the competition.
1994–2004: POST CIVIL WAR
Section::::1994–2004: Post Civil War.
Lebanon's first official World Cup campaign after the Civil War was in 1994, with Adnan Al-Shargi as their coach. After two wins, two losses and four draws Lebanon finished third in its group and was eliminated.
Under the Welsh manager Terry Yorath, the first foreign manager to lead the team after the Civil War, Lebanon began its first official post-war Asian campaign to qualify for the 1996 AFC Asian Cup. Despite winning twice against Turkmenistan, Lebanon was eliminated from the competition with a one point difference to Kuwait, the group leaders.
Lebanon was drawn into a group that included Kuwait and Singapore in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Led by Terry Yorath, the Cedars were eliminated having only gained four points.
In 2000, Lebanon hosted the AFC Asian Cup despite concerns by FIFA regarding the stadiums' conditions. Under Croatian coach Josip Skoblar, Lebanon, captained by Jamal Taha, was drawn into Group A alongside Iran, Iraq and Thailand; they finished last in the group with only two points.
During the 2002 World Cup qualifications, Lebanon, managed by the German coach Theo Bücker, was drawn with Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand in the first round. The side, equipped with great attacking prowess in players such as Roda Antar, Haitham Zein, Wartan Ghazarian and Gilberto dos Santos, managed a second place finish in their group with 26 goals scored in 6 games, the most in their group.
Under the French coach Richard Tardy, Lebanon was drawn in Group D of the 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers. It was reported that, prior to the Lebanon-North Korea fixture, the Lebanese camp had been mistreated as hotel conditions were very poor and their training field contained goats and sheep. Lebanon finished in third place of its respective group having only claimed four points.
Drawn into the second round of the qualifiers for the 2006 World Cup, Lebanon were grouped with South Korea, Vietnam and Maldives. Coach Mahmoud Hamoud, however, didn't manage to qualify the Lebanese side to the World Cup, finishing second in their group.
2006–2011: DECLINE
Section::::2006–2011: Decline.
Lebanon was drawn into Group D for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup qualifying campaign with Australia, Bahrain and Kuwait. The scheduled meeting of Australia and Lebanon made Buddy Farah, an Australian player of Lebanese descent, declare his return to the national side. Prior to Lebanon's fixture with Bahrain on 16 August 2006, it was announced on 1 August that the AFC had accepted a withdrawal request from the Lebanon Football Association due to the 2006 Lebanon War, which forced several players to leave their homes to evade the war.
In 2007 the Lebanese side was seeded into the first round of the qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup, where they faced India in a bid to qualify directly for the third round of the qualifiers. Lebanon would win 6–3 on aggregate against India and advance to the third round, with 2 goals coming from Mohammed Ghaddar in the second leg. The campaign saw the absence of defender Youssef Mohamad who reportedly had a disagreement with Lebanon's assistant coach Adnan Meckdache where he had intensely criticized the Lebanese Football Federation and the national team coach. He was suspended by the Football Federation and would be allowed to return on the condition that he would apologize to the Lebanese FA and its national team coach for the critical stance. Lebanon was then grouped with Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Uzbekistan, in which they finished last without any points.
In April 2008, Lebanon and Maldives, the then two lowest-ranked teams in the seedings, played home-and-away matches in the preliminary round of the 2011 Asian Cup, where the winner would proceed to the next round of the qualifiers. A 4–0 home win and a 2–1 in the return leg secured qualification to the qualifying round. Lebanon was then drawn into Group D of the qualifiers along with China, Syria and Vietnam in which they finished in last place.
Under coach Emile Rustom, who was re-appointed as head coach of the national team, Lebanon were drawn into the second round of the 2014 World Cup qualifiers where they faced Bangladesh. Lebanon defeated Bangladesh 4–0 in Beirut on 23 July, before losing 2–0 in Dhaka five days later. Lebanon advanced to the third round of qualifiers where they were grouped with South Korea, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates, just under one week later Emile Rustom resigned as head coach, citing obstacles such as internal administrative problems as the reason for his departure.
2011–2014: STAGNATION
Section::::2011–2014: Stagnation.
On 4 August 2011, it was reported that Theo Bücker was announced as Lebanon's new head coach. The former national team manager took over the reins nine years after leaving the position, bringing with him the intention of looking to "showcase Lebanese talent and give a good account of the game in the country." On 6 September, Lebanon came back from a goal down to beat the United Arab Emirates 3–1; after UAE striker Mahmoud Khamees put the visitors in front after 15 minutes, Lebanon replied with goals from Mohammed Ghaddar, Akram Moghrabi and Roda Antar, with the latter being awarded man of the match.
Lebanon then hosted Kuwait in Beirut on 11 October in a game that ended 3–1; approximately 32,000 spectators were present at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium for the first time since 2005 when the Lebanese FA had barred fans from entering the stadiums due to bad behaviour. Bad behaviour from the fans, mostly related to playing with fireworks, was again the case against Kuwait as it forced Japanese referee Masaaki Toma into stopping the game on numerous occasions. On 11 November, Lebanon beat Kuwait 1–0 with a goal scored by Mahmoud El Ali at the 57th minute at the Peace and Friendship Stadium in Kuwait City; it was the first time Kuwait had lost to Lebanon on home soil.
On 15 November 2011, Lebanon hosted South Korea at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium in Beirut; over 40,000 spectators were present to cheer for the Lebanese national team. After 4 minutes Lebanon took the lead by Ali Al Saadi, the lead however didn't last long as 11 minutes later Korea equalized the scoreline by a penalty kick. At the 30th minute of the match Lebanon was given a penalty kick after Mahmoud El Ali was tackled inside the penalty area; Abbas Ali Atwi subsequently converted the penalty giving Lebanon a 2–1 victory. This proved to be Lebanon's first ever win against South Korea; thanks to this win, Lebanon qualified to the fourth and final qualifying round for their first time in history.
Lebanon was drawn in Group A of the Fourth Round along with South Korea, Uzbekistan, Iran, and Qatar. Against Iran, a first-half Roda Antar goal gave Lebanon the lead in Beirut to keep The Cedars' faint hopes of scrapping through to Brazil alive. Antar rose above the Iranian defense to head home a free kick from Mohammad Haidar in the 28th minute, giving Lebanon their first ever goal against Iran. It proved to be the winner as Lebanon defended well for the rest of the game to deny the Iranians and claim all three points in the Asian Group A.
On 26 February 2013, national team players Ramez Dayoub and Mahmoud El Ali were involved in the 2013 Lebanese match fixing scandal: they had been accused of illegal betting on several matches concerning Lebanese teams and the national team as well as manipulating results. Both players received a fine of $15,000 and were banned for life from the Lebanese Football Association.
The Lebanese dream was nearly over after a dramatic loss to Uzbekistan 0–1 at road. The following match witnessed a possible comeback for the Lebanese side, as they hosted South Korea in Beirut and were leading 1–0 until a shocking equalizer from the visitors in the 97th minute marked the elimination of Lebanon.
Lebanon were drawn into group B with Iran, Thailand, and Kuwait for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup qualifications, during which the Italian coach Giannini replaced Theo Bucker as head coach. On the newly appointed manager's debut game, in Matchday 3, Mohammad Ghaddar scored the equalizer against Kuwait in Beirut to earn a point for Lebanon. At the end of the qualifications, although Lebanon and China had the same points in the ranking of the third-placed teams, the latter had a higher goal difference by one goal, meaning China would go to Australia as the best third placed team instead of Lebanon. Despite that, the Lebanese considered that campaign as one of their greatest results in Lebanon's history since the 1996 qualifications.
2014–PRESENT: RISE OF A GENERATION
Section::::2014–present: Rise of a Generation.
Starting from 2014, because of the failed attempt in qualifying to the 2015 AFC Asian Cup in Australia, the Lebanese Football Federation decided to reform their national team by creating "model" based on what the Belgium national team had done before, especially during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. By inviting new players from nations which had a large Lebanese community, such as from the United States, Colombia, Germany, Denmark and Norway, there was hope in a rebirth of Lebanese football. Thus, despite it being just the beginning, the presence of many players of Lebanese descent in other countries, such as Miguel Layún in Mexico and Ahmad Elrich in Australia, and of legendary players and managers, such as Pierre Issa, Mário Zagallo, Branco and Ze Elias, inspired the Lebanese people to believe in a brighter future for Lebanese football.
On 8 September 2014, Lebanon played an unofficial FIFA match against the Brazilian Olympic team in Doha for the first time which ended in a 2–2 draw, after a goal scored by the Brazilian team, which gave them the momentary 2–1 lead, was incorrectly ruled onside; this match drew great praise from all Lebanese people for their performance in the match. Unfortunately, after Lebanon's 0–5 loss to Qatar, Giannini was suspected as the main culprit and was subsequently fired.
In 2015, Miodrag Radulovic was appointed as new coach of Lebanon following the departure of Giuseppe Giannini; he would lead Lebanon in the 2018 World Cup qualifications. The team was drawn into a group containing Asia's runners-up South Korea, Kuwait, Myanmar and Laos; it would be the second time that Lebanon has faced both South Korea and Kuwait in World Cup Qualifiers. Lebanon managed a second place finish in the group and, although eliminated from the World Cup qualifications, they would go on to play in the 2019 Asian Cup qualification third round.
The draw put Lebanon in Group B along with North Korea, Hong Kong and Malaysia. With 5 wins and 1 draw, Lebanon topped the group unbeaten and managed to clinch qualification to the Asian Cup for the first time (after qualifying as a host in 2000, the only previous time Lebanon participated in the event). Hassan Maatouk, who took over captainship from Roda Antar in 2016, was key in qualifying Lebanon to the Asian Cup, as he scored 5 goals in 6 games. During these qualifications Lebanon fielded various players of Lebanese origins born and raised in foreign countries, such as Hilal El-Helwe, Joan Oumari and Omar Bugiel from Germany, Soony Saad from the United States, Samir Ayass from Bulgaria and Adnan Haidar from Norway.
Although Radulovic failed to qualify the national team for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, he successfully helped Lebanon qualify for their first ever AFC Asian Cup in 2019, becoming the first Montenegrin manager to help a team qualify for a major tournament. Radulovic also managed to maintain a 15-game unbeaten run spanning from 24 March 2016 to 11 October 2018, winning 8 and drawing 7; during this period, in September 2018, Lebanon achieved their best ever FIFA ranking at 77th.
TEAM IMAGE
KITS AND COLOURS
Section::::Team image.
Section::::Kits and colours.
During their first match against Altak in 1934, Lebanon wore a white shirt with the Lebanese cedar, black shorts and white socks, while the goalkeeper wore a black shirt and white pants.
The Lebanese national team traditionally wears red as their first colours and white as their second colours. The choice of these colours originates from the national flag of Lebanon, composed of red, white and green, the latter of which has typically been reserved for the goalkeeper's kit. For the home shirt, Lebanon usually wears red shirt, shorts and socks (with either white or gold details); the away kit's colours are the inverse of the home ones, with a full white outfit accompanied by red or gold details.
In the 2000 AFC Asian Cup, Lebanon wore a red Adidas shirt with white details on the sides and a white collar, white shorts and red socks. In the 2019 capaign instead Lebanon would wear a full red kit manufactured by Capelli Sport, with the Lebanese cedar, the country's national symbol, present underneath the team's logo in a darker shade of red.
The kit has been manufactured by Capelli Sport since 2015; previous manufacturers include Diadora, Adidas and A-Line
