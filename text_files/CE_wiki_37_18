AIR FORCE TWO
Air Force Two is the air traffic control call sign held by any United States Air Force aircraft carrying the U.S. Vice President, but not the President. The term is often associated with the Boeing C-32, a modified 757 which is most commonly used as the Vice President's transport. Other 89th Airlift Wing aircraft, such as the Boeing C-40 Clipper, C-20B, C-37A, and C-37B have served in this role as well. The VC-25A, the aircraft most often used by the President as Air Force One, has also been used by the vice president as Air Force Two.
Although the U.S. Marine Corps carries the primary mission for helicopter support of both the president (Marine One) and vice president (Marine Two), UH-1N Twin Huey helicopters from the Air Force's 1st Helicopter Squadron are also used to support the Vice President in the Washington, D.C. area under the call sign Air Force Two.
