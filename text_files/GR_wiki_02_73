ADDITIONAL RULES
VISA EXEMPTIONS FOR SCHENGEN STATES
A STAY IN THE SCHENGEN AREA AS A WHOLE OF UP TO 3 MONTHS
Section::::Additional rules.
Section::::Visa exemptions for Schengen states.
Section::::A stay in the Schengen Area as a whole of up to 3 months.
New Zealand citizens are classified as 'Annex II' foreign nationals, and so are permitted to stay visa-free in the 26 member states of the Schengen Area as a whole — rather than each country individually — for a period not exceeding 3 months every 6 months.
A STAY IN THE SCHENGEN AREA AS A WHOLE OF MORE THAN 3 MONTHS (BUT NO MORE THAN 3 MONTHS IN ANY INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATE)
Section::::A stay in the Schengen Area as a whole of more than 3 months (but no more than 3 months in any individual member state).
The New Zealand Government has signed bilateral visa waiver agreements with a number of the individual countries who are Schengen signatories, which allow New Zealand citizens to spend up to three months in the relevant country, without reference to time spent in other Schengen signatory states. Since these agreements continue to remain valid despite the implementation of the Schengen agreement, the European Commission has confirmed that in practice if New Zealanders visit Schengen countries which have signed these types of bilateral agreements with New Zealand, then the terms of these agreements override the conditions normally imposed as a result of the Schengen visa exemption agreement.
New Zealand has individual bilateral visa waiver agreements with the following Schengen signatories:
valign=top
valign=top
Consequently, New Zealand citizens can visit the above Schengen member states visa-free for periods of up to 3 months in each country. If, however, a New Zealand citizen then visits another Schengen state not included in the list above, the restriction of no more than 3 months out of a 6-month period in the Schengen area as a whole applies. Therefore, if a New Zealand citizen has already spent 3 months in one or more of the above Schengen countries, any visits to another Schengen country without a bilateral visa waiver agreement with New Zealand may lead to difficulties with local law enforcement agencies (e.g. being accused of having overstayed upon leaving a Schengen country which is not in the list above).
In addition, a New Zealand citizen who has already spent up to 3 months in other parts of the Schengen Area can enter Hungary and remain there for up to a further 90 days visa-free. Following the stay in Hungary, if 3 months has already spent elsewhere in the Schengen area, he/she must then leave the Schengen area from Hungary and go directly to a country outside the Schengen Area.
A STAY IN THE SCHENGEN AREA AS A WHOLE OF MORE THAN 3 MONTHS (AND MORE THAN 3 MONTHS IN AN INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATE)
Section::::A stay in the Schengen Area as a whole of more than 3 months (and more than 3 months in an individual member state).
In general, any person who is not a European Union, European Economic Area or Swiss citizen and who wishes to stay in a Schengen member state for more than 3 months is required to obtain a national long-stay 'D' visa and/or a residence permit. New Zealand citizens aged 18–30 (or 18-35 in some cases) are able to obtain a national long-stay 'D' visa and/or a residence permit from 19 Schengen member states on the basis of a working holiday (see below). Schengen member states also issue national long-stay 'D' visas and residence permits for other reasons to those fulfilling criteria laid out in their national immigration policies (e.g. skilled workers, students, au pair).
In general, the national long-stay 'D' visa/residence permit needs to be obtained in advance through the member state's embassy/consulate. However, some Schengen member states offer exceptions for New Zealand citizens.
The allows New Zealand citizens to apply for a work visa under a special scheme known as a 'Green Card' (rather than a 'Blue Card' or work permit which is required by most non-EU citizens). The application for a Green Card can be lodged at any Czech embassy/consulate (or, in some circumstances, within the Czech Republic if the applicant is already resident there) and is usually processed within 60 days.
As of 24 June 2014, it is no longer possible to apply for a green card. This type of permit was replaced 
VISA EXEMPTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM
Section::::Visa exemptions and requirements for the United Kingdom.
New Zealand citizens are able to visit the United Kingdom for up to 6 months (or 3 months if they enter from the Republic of Ireland) without the need to apply for a visa as long as they fulfil all of the following criteria:
* they do not work during their stay in the UK
* they must not register a marriage or register a civil partnership during their stay in the UK
* they can present evidence of sufficient money to fund their stay in the UK (if requested by the border inspection officer)
* they intend to leave the UK at the end of their visit and can meet the cost of the return/onward journey
* they have completed a landing card and submitted it at passport control unless in direct transit to a destination outside the Common Travel Area
* if under the age of 18, they can demonstrate evidence of suitable care arrangements and parental (or guardian's) consent for their stay in the UK
However, even though, strictly speaking, he/she is not required to apply for a visa if he/she satisfies all of the above criteria, a New Zealand citizen who falls into any of the following categories has been strongly advised by the UK Border Agency (replaced by UK Visas and Immigration) to apply for a visa prior to travelling to the UK:
* he/she has any unspent criminal convictions in any country
* he/she has previously been refused or breached the terms of any entry to the UK, or been deported or otherwise removed from the UK
* he/she has previously applied for a visa and been refused one
* he/she has been warned by a UK official that he/she should obtain a visa before travelling to the UK
New Zealand citizens who were born before 1983 and qualify for the right of abode are able to live and work in the United Kingdom indefinitely.
New Zealand citizens with a grandparent born either in the United Kingdom, Channel Islands or Isle of Man at any time or in the Republic of Ireland on or before 31 March 1922 can apply for UK Ancestry Entry Clearance, which enables them to work in the UK for 5 years, after which they can apply to settle indefinitely.
New Zealand citizens aged 18 to 30 can apply for a Youth Mobility Scheme visa which allows them to pursue a working holiday in the UK for 2 years.
New Zealand citizens can study in the United Kingdom for up to 6 months as a student visitor without the need to apply for a visa as long as they do not work during this period. If attending a course which is longer than 6 months, New Zealand citizens can apply for a Tier 4 student visa in New Zealand or in the UK merely by completing the application form, quoting the Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) reference number issued to them by their UK education provider and presenting evidence of care arrangements (if under the age of 18); they do not need to submit proof of sufficient funds, qualifications or English language ability (which most other foreign nationals need to demonstrate) as long as the UK education provider is recognised as a 'Highly Trusted' sponsor by the UK Border Agency. However, the UK Border Agency reserves the right to request such evidence in particular situations and New Zealand citizens must still present such evidence if applying for a Tier 4 student visa outside New Zealand or the UK. New Zealand citizens who have been issued with a Tier 4 student visa (but not those who are in the UK as student visitors) can work in the UK for up to 20 hours per week during term-time and without time restrictions outside term-time.
VISA EXEMPTION FOR AUSTRALIA
Section::::Visa exemption for Australia.
By virtue of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, New Zealand citizens are granted a Special Category Visa on arrival in Australia (which permits residence and work for an indefinite period) as long as:
* they present a valid New Zealand passport
* they have no criminal convictions
* they have no untreated tuberculosis
* they have not been deported, excluded or removed from any country
The same privilege is extended to Australian citizens and PR holders.
